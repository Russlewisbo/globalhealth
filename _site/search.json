    "text": "In Module 2 we examined the crises in antibiotic development including its impact on low-middle income countries (LMICs). We also highlighted special challenges related to antibiotic access in countries where healthcare resources are limited. In this module we will further explore the challenges of improving antibiotic or vaccine availability and access to diagnostic testing through recent experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of December 30, 2022, the WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard reports over 663 million cumulative cases and 6.7 million deaths due to SARS-CoV-2. Over 200 cases new cases are still reported daily. Beyond direct illness and death, COVID-19 has spawned countless repercussions from mental health to a global supply chain breakdown. Some issues were predictable and some impossible to foresee in the area of global health, for example:\n\nTB deaths also climbed worldwide for the first time in a decade, according to a October 14, 2022 WHO report that directly tied the increase to the pandemic.\nMeasles outbreaks may be more likely in the near future, after the number of infants missing their first vaccination jumped by 3 million last year—the largest increase in 20 years.\nMalaria’s 241 million cases and 627,000 deaths in 2020 reflect increases of 14 million and 69,000 respectively—both were largely attributed to pandemic disruptions, according to WHO’s global malaria report released on December 6.\n\nAccording to the WHO, over 11 billion people must be vaccinated against COVID-19. As of December 2022, 71.8% of the world population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. However, vaccination rates still lag in Africa Figure 1.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: WHO Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dashboard\n\n\nThe data highlighted in WHO dashboard show the African continent has been largely left behind in terms of COVID-19 vaccination. This lack of vaccine coverage may be a factor that is contributing to the emergence of new variants, which seem to have emerged from the African continent. However, access to testing and sequencing of strains is also limited in in many regions of Africa, so the current epidemiological picture of COVID is not entirely clear.\n\n\nThe COVAX program is a program for purchasing and distributing COVID-19 vaccine developed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that combines high-income (HIC) and low-middle-income countries (LMICs). The program is based on the idea that the world would unite and buy vaccines together, with high- and middle-income countries paying for themselves, and low-middle-income countries receiving subsidized doses. Once the vaccines were licensed and pre-qualified by the WHO, COVAX funds then pay for the purchase of doses for all 92 eligible countries. The guarantees were designed to provide incentives to manufacturers to ensure that enough doses are produced for LMIC economies, which collectively represent almost half the world’s population.\n\nHIC countries make higher contributions up-front in order to establish the funding to get manufacturing capacity in place. While it is not expected that they will entirely rely on the the program to receive vaccine, it was expected that vaccine purchases through the COVAX program would represent a type of “insurance” or back-up plan if other negotiated channels of vaccine distribution fell-through from manufactured because of supply problems.\nVaccine doses for LMICs will also be procured through the COVAX Facility but will be paid for via the separate financial mechanism of the COVAX, which will be largely funded through Official Development Assistance (ODA), as well as contributions from the private sector and philanthropy. Even so, it is likely that the 92 ODA-eligible countries accessing vaccines through the COVAX AMC would also be required to share some of the costs of COVID-19 vaccines and delivery. Through this cost-sharing approach, countries will have an opportunity to complement and build on the essential foundation built by these early, donor funded doses, if they wish to achieve a higher population coverage.\nTo help each economy, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi) provided up to US$ 150 million in initial funding to jumpstart readiness for planning, technical assistance and cold chain equipment needed to deliver the vaccines. The Alliance also developed a Country Readiness Assessment tool to aid development of a national vaccination deployment plan and public communications strategy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase 1 allocation by COVAX planned to allocate enough vaccine doses to cover 20% of the population until all participating countries reached this coverage level. This was intended to specifically target healthcare workers, elderly people, and vulnerable groups for protection by the 2021.\nPhase 2 of vaccine allocation by COVAX will take a more epidemiological approach, consisting of weighted allocation depending on the proportional coverage requested by countries and consideration of vulnerability and ongoing severity of the COVID-19 threat. IT was recognized that this would require sophisticated country level data collection that would take time to establish.\nUltimately, these goals meant that although COVAX promised 100 million doses by the end of March, this goal was not reached until 6 July. By mid-August of 2021, COVAX delivered 200 million vaccine doses to nearly 140 countries instead of the 600 million doses initially projected. In regions like sub-Saharan Africa, health officials are still struggling to get their hands on vaccines to protect workers on the front lines of the pandemic UNICEF COVID-19 vaccine dashboard. Click here to see a short You Tube video on vaccine roll-out efforts.\nHigh-income countries also did not ultimately did not surrender their negotiating power to international organizations such as COVAS/WHO. Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand, EU, and US secured >200% population coverage worth of vaccine doses, leaving insufficient for LMICs and COVAX. Wealthy countries soon rocketed ahead, COVAX’s pledge to distribute vaccines in poor countries at the same time they rolled out in rich countries in terms of vaccinations while LMICs were left behind.\nOne of the key sources of the vaccines for the COVAX program was the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine that through licensing agreements was being manufactured in part by the Serum Institute in India. However, when a third COVID-19 wave hit India, over 400 million doses of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine was diverted for domestic use in India. This created severe supply bottlenecks and continued vaccine nationalism that have prevented it from being able to access doses as quickly as possible.\n\nThese challenges illustrated a fundamental problem: HICs produce vaccines, invest in research development, and secure the supplies. This shuts the rest of the world out of the market.\nThe ultracold supply chain requirements of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be an insurmountable hurdle in LMICs, outside of major cities. COVID-19 vaccine delivery will require considerable investment of resources, health-care staff, and careful planning to avoid opportunity costs, including a disruption of routine health services and a decline in essential childhood vaccination coverage, which could result in outbreaks of measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is GAVI\n\n\n\nWhat is GAVI? By the late 1990s, the progress of international immunisation programmes was stalling. Nearly 30 million children in developing countries were not fully immunised against deadly diseases, and many others went without any immunisation at all. At the heart of the challenge was an acute market failure; powerful new vaccines were becoming available, but lower-income countries simply could not afford most vaccines. In response, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and a group of founding partners brought to life an elegant solution to encourage manufacturers to lower vaccine prices for the poorest countries in return for long-term, high-volume and predictable demand from those countries. In 2000, that breakthrough idea became the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation – today Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\nGAVI now vaccinates almost half of the world’s children, giving it tremendous power to negotiate vaccines at prices that are affordable for the poorest countries and to remove the commercial risks that previously kept manufacturers from serving them.Because of these market shaping efforts, the cost of fully immunising a child with all 11 WHO-recommended childhood vaccines now costs about US$ 28 in Gavi-supported countries, compared with approximately US$ 1,200 in the United States of America. At the same time, the pool of manufacturers producing prequalified Gavi-supported vaccines has grown from to 18 in 2020 (with more than half based in Africa, Asia and Latin America).\nGavi shares the cost that implementing countries pay for vaccines, which has resulted in more than 495 vaccine introductions and campaigns, dramatically boosting immunisation against virulent diseases. For example, 3% of low-income countries had introduced nationally Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine that protects against diseases like pneumonia and meningitis. Today, Gavi has enabled all low-income countries to introduce this vaccine in their national programmes. Progress on the third dose of Hib vaccine coverage, as well as with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), has been so successful that the coverage rate in Gavi-supported countries is now higher than the global average coverage rate. By the end of 2019, 16 countries had transitioned out of Gavi support and are fully financing all vaccine programmes introduced with Gavi support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: Lancet Infectious Diseases\n\n\n\n What can be done to address COVID-19 vaccine inequity?\nCOVID-19 vaccine inequity will have a lasting and profound impact on socio-economic recovery in LMICs without urgent action to boost supply, share vaccines and ensure they’re accessible to everyone now. To provide vaccination to 70% of the population, HICs must boost their healthcare spending by an average of 0.8%, whereas LMICs must boost healthcare spending by 56.6%.\nThree strategies could potentially improve the dire situation of COVID-19 vaccine inequity in LMICs\n\nBilateral donation of COVID-19 vaccine vaccine. HICs such as the United States have pledged to donate 1.1 billion doses to other countries. But deliveries so far have generally fallen drastically short of pledges.\nMultilateral donation of COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple countries have pledged to donate COVID-19 vaccine to Gavi and the WHO, although similar to the U.S. the actual deliveries are well behind schedule.\nCreation of manufacturing capacity in LMICs. Africa consumes 25% of the world’s vaccines, but do not manufacture any of them. Access to vaccines could be improved if some of the manufacturing could be moved to the African continent. This would require a temporary intellectual property (IP) waiver for COVID-19 vaccines,[1]The waiver would prevent companies that hold the IP for COVID-19 vaccines from blocking vaccine production elsewhere on the grounds of IP and allow countries to produce COVID-19 medical goods locally and import or export them expeditiously. This IP waiver has been supported by the World Trade Organization and several nations, but faces stiff political and pharmaceutical-industry industrial opposition. No agency is mandated to finance and strengthen manufacturing capacity for vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Expanding regional capacity for key platform technologies (eg. monoclonal antibodies and mRNA) to avoid reliance on few manufacturers and fortify supply systems should be a priority and will be essential for preparation for future pandemics. It requires transfer of highly specific and specialised technology and know-how, in coordination with regulatory oversight, robust participation of vaccine developers, and application of good, consistent, laboratory biological manufacturing practices, and addressing financial sustainability of such facilities. Given the large challenges, a strong system is required to accelerate progress. Platforms and tools to enable technology transfer, such as the COVID-19 technology access pool (C-TAP) and the WHO vaccine technology transfer hub have not been effectively used. The intellectual property right TRIPS waiver proposed by South Africa and India was not supported by several high income countries. Recently, some progress has been made in this area with approval of mRNA vaccine capability in South Africa. Recently a new COVID-19 vaccine was approved/licensed for COVID-19 designed specifically for global health- is made using technology that has been employed worldwide for decades, meaning that manufacturing processes are generally already well-known and won’t require a steep learning curve like the one needed for the scale-up of new technologies such as mRNA, adenovirus and protein particle vaccines.\nImprovements in allocation and delivery of vaccines Countries often receive notice on vaccine allocation without knowing when doses will arrive. This makes the planning of vaccination difficult and slows down the preparation for vaccinations, including the use of funds from the World Bank and other institutions. It wasessential that countries were well-prepared when the planned large quantities of doses arrives in late 2021 and across 2022, as infrastructure for vaccination in many LMICs is already inadequate, as shown by the 19.7 million under-vaccinated infants globally, most of whom are in these countries. Many LMICs, particularly in Africa, are experiencing substantial difficulties with distribution, administration, and uptake (including from vaccine hesitancy). High level political leadership on vaccine supply and deployment have not taken place at global level despite their critical importance for exiting this health crises.\n\n\n\n\nRelatively less attention has been directed on improving diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 testing in LMICs. Many countries lack of a country-based testing plan and have limited access to molecular (PCR) and even simple antigen (lateral flow) tests or serology. This creates challenges for understanding the epidemiology and current status of the disease in many regions. Other countries have adopted diagnostic algorithms that test only selected patients based on pre-existing diseases or meet a standard case-definition based on a common, and their presentation could easily be similar to that of COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThe WHO recommends infection control interventions to reduce the risk of transmission, in particular, avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections, frequent hand washing especially after direct contact with infected people or their environment. Worldwide, governments have established regulations that require social distancing, the closure of non-essential businesses, travel restrictions and, in many cases, quarantine. Although these measures are necessary for public health, social restrictions are difficult to realize in LMICs due to money-related livelihood problems. A complete commercial shutdown like those imposed in China, Europe, or the United States may not be feasible from some residents of LMICs when a day without work is tantamount to a day without food.\nThe procurement of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks and protective faceshields/gowns is also a challenge. In emergency situations, raincoats and windjackets are often used as gowns, while swimming caps, goggles, and transparent paper were used as PPE. Healthcare facilities do not have the necessary space and resources to screen and treatment of COVID-19 patients separate areas and patients devoted to non-COVID-19 healthcare, facilitating the spread of the infection.[2]\n\n\n\nThe number of hospital beds and health workers is generally lower compared to that in HICs. The WHO reports only 0.8 hospital beds per 1000 people in LICs and 2.3 in LMICs. According to the WHO, 90% of LICs have fewer than 10 medical doctors per 10,000 people, compared to only 5% of HICs. Up to 93% of LICs have fewer than 40 nursing personnel per 10,000 people, compared to only 19% of HICs\nThe number of ICU beds is insufficient with respect to the population of LMICs [2]. The most recent data available from the WHO indicate that Africa has fewer than 5000 ICU beds, corresponding to five beds per one million people. In Europe, by comparison, there are 4000 beds per one million people.\nICUs in LMICs are more likely to have equipment is often old and poorly serviced. Mechanical ventilators tend to be older, and many hospitals do not have oxygen or medical gas to drive them. Generally, equipment maintenance is poorly performed, and funding for capital development is limited. When funding is available, the procurement systems are often plagued by corruption, leading to a fraudulent assignment. Furthermore, long distances and high transportation costs commonly result in delayed presentation of critically ill patients.\nLaboratories are often located in the capital cities, so that early diagnosis and isolation becomes difficult."

    "text": "ACCESS TO COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT)\nAccess to COVID-19 therapeutics have not yet received the same financial and political commitments as vaccines. Waning immunity and potential emergence of vaccine resistance among new variants may also compromise impact of vaccines. As has been the case with other vaccine-preventable illnesses such as bacterial meningitis, pertussis, and influenza, therapeutics can play an important role in disease control alongside vaccines. The Access to COVID -19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) is a multilateral coordination mechanism set up to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines globally. The concept brings together governments,scientists, businesses, civil society, philanthropists and global health organisations.\nDespite its bold vision, ACT-A has thus far fallen short of its expectations. As described above, COVAX, the vaccines pillar of ACT-A, failed to meet the relative modest goals of 20% vaccination. Oxygen therapy, still one of the best treatments available for severe cases, has not been strategically prioritised despite its critical importance. Testing did receive political attention but has been a bottleneck in many countries.\nThe Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator brings together governments, scientists, businesses, civil society, and philanthropists and global health organizations (the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, FIND, Gavi, The Global Fund,Unitaid, Wellcome, the WHO, and the World Bank).These organizations have joined forces to speed up an end to the pandemic by supporting the development and equitable distribution of the tests, treatments and vaccines the world needs to reduce mortality and severe disease, restoring full societal and economic activity globally in the near term, and facilitating high-level control of COVID-19 disease in the medium term.\nIdentifying inexpensive, widely available, and effective therapies against COVID-19 is, therefore, of great importance. Current effective and inexpensive therapies include corticosteroids (dexamethasone) the potentially useful serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluvoxamine. However, access to potent anti-inflammatory agents, monoclonal antibodies, or antivirals is still limited.\nGlobal efforts to date have been unsuccessful in providing equitable access to covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. A core underlying issue has been a lack of shared vision that these essential public health tools should be considered a “global health commons”. Future systems for vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics should be pre-negotiated among countries, manufacturers, and international institutions. Future systems should be reshaped to ensure equitable access is considered from design through to manufacturing and procurement processes. Agreements around technology transfer and intellectual property licensing, regional trial networks, inclusive governance, and substantial predictable financing are essential\n\n\n\n\nImage: World Health Organization"

    "text": "Medicines Patent Pool\nThe Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) is a United Nations-backed public health organisation working to increase access to, and facilitate the development of, life-saving medicines for low- and middle-income countries. Through its innovative business model, MPP partners with civil society, governments, international organisations, industry, patient groups, and other stakeholders, to prioritise and license needed medicines and pool intellectual property to license the generic manufacture and the development of new formulations in developing countries Figure 2.\nHow does it work? MPP operates as a non-profit voluntary licensing mechanism through partnerships with originator pharmaceutical companies who develop innovative medications (i.e. more effective and less toxic) but are still patent protected.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: How the Medicines Patient Pool licences medicines for public health\n\n\nMPP negotiates licences with patent holders (originator) and sub-licenses rights to manufacture and distribute the drug in the country of interest to generic manufacturers, sometimes in exchange for royalties to the original innovator Figure 3. In turn, the MPP ensures that the drugs are appropriately registered in the country, their is adequate competition for production of the medication (to keep prices low and prevent a monopoly), and promotes rapid uptake and utilization in the health through communication and agreements with governmental, medical and patient advocacy groups.\nThe advantages are three fold:\n\nInnovators have their drug manufactured and distributed in LMICs using a proven mechanism with oversight and receive royalty payments\nGeneric companies have access to manufacture and distribute innovative medicines that are still on patient\nPatients get access to affordable and more effective medications that saves lives\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: How the Medicines Patient Pool licences medicines for public health\n\n\nFor an excellent explanation of the how the Medicine Patnet Pools works, see this explanation by Dr. Greg Martin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnVJPQ1ZINw\n\nMPP and COVID-19\nThe MPP created a mRNA vaccine Technology Transfer Hub in July 2021. The purpose of the hub is to increase access to mRNA vaccines made closer to home by establishing manufacturing capacity in Africa using a technology transfer hub model to ensure sustainable vaccine security in future pandemics. The first COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology transfer hub has been established in South Africa. The MPP has also entered into license agreements agreements for Merck’s molnupiravir and Pfizer ritonavir/nirmatrelvir oral COVID-29 therapies. The MPP has also licensed an ELISA antibody technology for serologic testing\n\n\nMPP and HIV\nToday, only a third of the people requiring treatment for HIV/AIDS have access to therapy. Drug resistance means that new drugs are required to treat the condition, but these are often unaffordable for the most affected communities. To date, MPP has signed agreements with ten patent holders for 13 HIV antiretrovirals and a technology for injectable long-acting HIV drug combination technology.\n\n\nMPP and Hepatitis C\nAround 58 million people live globally with HCV, many of them in LMICs, with the vast majority remaining undiagnosed and untreated. New direct-acting antivirals (DAA) that are effective across all major HCV strains can cure millions. Yet, approximately 84% of the people infected with HCV are not receiving treatment Around 290,000 people die each year from hepatitis C, mostly from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Direct-acting antiviral medicines can cure more than 95% of patients. The Medicines Patent Pool works with generic partners to speed the development and distribution of these new treatments that can eliminate the virus through a short course of oral therapy in regions with a high HCV burden.\nMPP signed licence agreements for three hepatitis C treatments: daclatasvir (DAC) in 2015, ravidasvir (RAV) in 2017 and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in 2018.\nMPP has also secured licenses for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), benefit people living with HIV as well as people living with chronic hepatitis B, a disease affecting 296 million globally. The majority of people with hepatitis B live in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n\nTuberculosis\nTuberculosis (TB) is a global pandemic affecting around 10 million people worldwide. In 2018, the disease caused 1.5 million deaths, and it is the leading killer of people living with HIV. Almost 90% of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. The World Health Organization’s post-2015 Global TB Strategy sets ambitious targets aimed at reducing TB deaths by 95% between 2015 and 2035, and to end TB. To meet these targets, faster acting, better therapies to treat TB are urgent, particularly for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). The MPP’s fovus is to secure access to new treatments for MDR-TB and drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Th MPP also facilitates the development of new regimens by licensing TB drugs that are still under development. In early 2017, MPP signed its first agreement with the Johns Hopkins University. This agreement was to facilitate the clinical development of sutezolid, a promising investigational treatment for tuberculosis. It was followed by a second agreement with Pfizer in October 2019 to access Pfizer’s preclinical, phase I and phase IIa clinical study data and results on sutezolid.\n\n\nIs the Medicines Patient Pool Working?\nThe Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) has signed agreements with 13 patent holders for thirteen HIV antiretrovirals, one HIV technology platform, three hepatitis C direct-acting antivirals, a tuberculosis treatment, two long-acting technologies, two experimental oral antiviral treatments for COVID-19 and a COVID-19 serological antibody diagnostic test. 25 generic manufacturers and product developers have now signed MPP sub-licensing agreements.\nGeneric competition is making a difference in fostering lower prices and improving treatment coverage. Generic partners have distributed 49.71 million patient-years of HIV and hepatitis C products, saving international purchasers USD 920 million (January 2012-December 2020)Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Impact of the Medicines Patent Pool.

    "section": "Counterfeit Medications",
    "text": "Counterfeit Medications\nWhat is a fake medicine?\nInterpol defines a counterfeit or substandard medicine as one that differs from the authentic version of the vaccine by:\n\nContaining too much or too little of one or more ingredients, or containing different ingredients\nClaiming to have different properties or side effects\nHaving a different shape, size, taste, or colour\nBeing not correctly labelled or not labelled at all\nHaving an out-of-date or missing expiry date\nNot including information on how to store the medicine\nHaving packaging that looks poorly constructed, is labelled with spelling or grammar errors, or appears to have been interfered with\n\nWHO estimates that up to 1% of medicines available in high income countries are likely to be counterfeit, but this figure rises to 10% globally. In LMICs, 1 in 10 medicines are thought to be either substandard or falsified. Nearly 170,000 children die annually of falsified pneumonia medicines and substandard and falsified antimalarials may cause as many as 116,000 deaths from malaria annually in sub-Saharan Africa. The limited data available on this issue means the known figures almost certainly represent just a fraction of the true burden of falsified medicines around the globe.\nAntibiotics are the most counterfeited medicines and account for 28% of global counterfeit medicines [3]. Over 75% of counterfeit antibiotics come from South-East Asia and their destination is mainly emerging countries (South-East Asia: 44%; sub-Saharan Africa: 30%; Europe, North America: 9%; others: 16%). Counterfeit antibiotics are antibiotics that have been commonly used for years (beta-lactams: 50%; quinolones: 12%; macrolides, lincosamides, and synergistins: 1%; cyclins: 7%; others: 20%). The main counterfeit formulations (77%) concern oral administration (tablets, syrup, capsules) whereas injected drugs account for only 17% of counterfeit formulations, and eye drops and ointments 6%.\nIn the past year, the black market in fake medicines grew by more than 400%, according to a report by the Medicine Quality Research Group, Centre of Tropical Medicine & Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine and the University of Oxford. [4]There is a growing online trend of fake websites that mimic real pharmaceutical websites where COVID-19 vaccines are sold up to $1000 and vaccine certificates for $200. Moreover, the “trickle down” of vaccine donations from richer countries has left populations—and particularly health workers—in LMICs vulnerable to infection, with some turning to unlicensed vendors for vaccines Figure 5.\nWHO has warned that the vaccine equity gap continues to be exploited by organised criminal groups for profit as they pivot from personal protective equipment and diagnostics towards vaccines. Given that fake vaccine cards and passports are becoming a profitable business, authorities have urge citizens not to share photos of them on social media. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to share vaccine rollout in an equitable way around the globe so poorer countries are protected against the proliferation of falsified medicines.\nThe globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry has made tracking fake and substandard products more difficult worldwide.[5] For example, Active ingredients may come from China, while the product may be manufactured in India and be packaged in a third country before being shipped through Dubai. It might then be repackaged and shipped to yet another country to take advantage of exchange rates. These many steps provide places for fraud to occur.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Sources of counterfeit drugs. Source Financial Times\n\n\nA common practice is to procure empty vials and refill them with saline solution or substandard products. “Knock-offs” that contain lower concentrations of the active pharmaceutical ingredients than the official drug are also common. Small pharma companies, especially those which do outsource work for big companies, may flout good manufacturing practices to cut costs. In India, counterfeits are produced by non authorized drug manufacturers or authorized drug manufacturers secretly manufacturing counterfeit drugs besides their authorized quota, or importers repacking real but outdated drugs coming from China for biological products difficult to manufacture such as immunoglobulins.\nCounterfeit drugs are manufactured in countries which cannot guarantee good purchase practices and which have either too few or no regulation for distribution circuits. The lack of control, or their lax security or non effectiveness, support the distribution of counterfeit drugs in national or illegal distribution circuits. This weakness is enhanced by the insufficiency of human and financial resources dedicated to control activities. Even if the pharmaceutical industry massively invests in the research of tools or technologies for the prevention and detection of counterfeit drugs and in the implementation of procedures that could help healthcare professionals and patients discriminate between real and counterfeit drugs, the international collaboration required to guarantee the application and the development of such mechanisms is often lacking.\nThe legal systems of most countries do not take into account the public health issue and do not consider counterfeiting of drugs as a more severe crime than counterfeiting of luxury goods, laws having been conceived more to protect brands. Thus, in the USA, the penalty for counterfeiting a t-shirt infringing intellectual property is 10 years, whereas it can be only one year for counterfeiting a drug. According to The International Drug Industry Federation, the counterfeit drug market is 25 times more lucrative for counterfeiters than that of heroin and 5 times more than that of cigarettes.\nHow to spot a counterfeit medicine according to Interpol: looking for the “six Ps” is a starting point to identify a falsified medical product:\n\nPlace—Never buy medicines from unknown websites or in a marketplace. If you are unsure about a supplier’s credentials, check the list of registered dispensaries at your local health regulatory body •\nPrescriptions—Only buy medicine that has been prescribed by your doctor or healthcare professional. When buying online, make sure the website requires you to present a prescription. Do not buy from websites that offer prescriptions on the basis of questionnaires or do not have a contactable pharmacist\nPromises—Be wary of pharmacies that offer “too good to be true” promises. False promises to watch out for are “cures all types” of a major illness, “money-back guarantee”, “no risk”, or “limited supply—buy in advance”\nPrice—Check the price against products you usually buy or with reputable providers. If it is substantially cheaper, it is likely to be a fake\nPrivacy—The trade in fake medical products has been linked to credit card fraud and identity theft. Do not reveal any personal information beyond appropriate medical details\nProduct—Compare the medicines with your usual prescription\n\n\nSpecific problems with counterfeited antibiotics\nCounterfeit drugs are often commonly used antibiotics- the “old” antibiotics such as beta-lactams, tetracycline, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol; the latest generations are rarely counterfeited. Most of the antibiotics counterfeited are on the WHO essential drugs list. The most common types of counterfeiting include:\n\nCounterfeits without active ingredient (most common). The active ingredient is replaced by cheap substances such as flour in the oral formulations. or injectable presentations.\nBad quality counterfeits. They medicine may contain excipients or active ingredients unadapted for the drug. These products may contain toxic or pathogenic chemical impurities. For examaple, counterfit injectables have been found to contain methanol, a potentially lethal product for humans at low doses.\nCounterfeits with inadequate active ingredient. These concern real drugs, less expensive or outdated, first collected, opened, then repacked. It works both ways; an antibiotic may be replaced by the active ingredient of another class and vice versa. For example, in Nigeria, a counterfeiter had reconditioned diazepam syrup (benzodiazepine) and had sold it asan antibiotic under the original name of co-trimoxazole [3]\nCounterfeit packaging. The counterfeiting may be made at various levels. False representation of identity is commonly used, either partially or totally by copying the packaging of another marketed product. The brand name may be modified to try to escape laws on infringing intellectual property\n\nCounterfeit antibiotics cause hundreds of deaths every year worldwide, especially in South-East Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa. No counterfeit antibiotic has ever been reported to be effective.If a patient takes counterfeit antibiotics without any active ingredient or with too small doses, in the best of cases, he will consult with his physician again when noting the absence of improvement after treatment initiation, until he is cured. In extreme cases, the untreated infection will develop into septicemia. Taking counterfeit antibiotics may induce adverse effects because of a different active ingredient or because of potentially toxic chemical ingredients or de pathogenic contaminant.The counterfeiting of antibiotics directly promotes the emergence of acquired bacterial resistance against antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe human cost of counterfeit medications\n\n\n\nThe day Victoria Amponsah was diagnosed with malaria she also learned that she was two months pregnant. She left the hospital with a prescription for an anti-malarial drug and, like patients anywhere else in the world, went to a local pharmacy believing that the medicine she purchased would treat her condition. Victoria bought what she thought was a genuine, effective drug, but that was not the case. Her condition quickly worsened and within hours she was admitted to the hospital, learning later that she had been sold counterfeit pills.\nFortunately, Victoria and her baby survived the trauma and successfully fought off malaria, but this would not be her only personal encounter with fake medicine. At the end of her healthy pregnancy, she was deceived by a fake version of oxytocin, disguised in an official-looking package. Within thirty minutes, Victoria started sweating, shaking, vomiting and bleeding. She was in the hospital for two days, nearly lost her baby and had to return to the hospital every week after the incident for some time.\nAs Victoria knows all too well, fake medicine can threaten your health or even claim your life. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 700,000 people die every year from fake malaria and tuberculosis drugs alone. The WHO also estimates that 25-60% of the medicine supply in developing countries is either substandard or counterfeit. To wathc a video describing Victoria’s story, see the following YouTubeVideo produced the US Pharmacopia: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AMOn00dQsU&t=64s\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can drug counterfeiting be reduced?\nThe International Medical Products AntiCounterfeiting Taskforce was created in 2006 by the WHO with the objectives of preventing the manufacture and the sale of counterfeit drugs, and to facilitate communication and collaboration between all the partners to coordinate the actions implemented to monitor and eliminate drug counterfeiting. The group has worked in 4 areas to address drug counterfeiting:\n\nDevelopment of guidance documents for principles and Elements to include in national laws against the counterfeiting of medical product.\nImplementation of regulations. It gives advice to national authorities to improve controls, toolsfor national evaluation, and models of procedures to deal with counterfeit drugs.\nTraining of personnel in charge of control of drug counterfeiting and collaboration between the various authorities of each country. For example, Operation Storm II was coordinated by Interpol and the West-Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) of the WHO The platform improved collaboration between the police, the customs, and the drug regulatory authorities of international organizations and private sector. This operation led to 30 arrests and confiscating 12 million counterfeit drugs, including antibiotics, between July and November 2009. This action also led to closing 100 illicit pharmacies and sales points.\nDevelopment of technology for tracking and monitoring antibiotic prescriptions to ensure authenticity.\nHealth-care provider and patient awareness. created model supports to sensitize healthcare professionals and patients about warning signs and risks of countnerfiet medications.\n\nIn 2019, The European Medicines Agency instituted new regulations for drug supply chain traceability and verification systems-“track and trace” to mitigate the risk of shortages and fight production and marketing of counterfeit drugs. The regulation also required new safety features (a unique identifier both in human readable format and encoded in 2D data matrix, as well as an anti-tampering device) to be placed on individual packs of virtually all prescription medicines, and related compliance reporting.\nThe European Council set up the international convention Medicrime open to member countries but also to other countries [31]. This convention was adopted by the European Council on December 8, 2010, and signed on October 28, 2011. It prosecutes the counterfeiting of medical products and is thus the first constraining judicial instrument in the domain of penal law.\nIn some African countries, counterfeiting is a commercial crime but only penalized by a small fine. In India, counterfeiters can be sentenced to of 3 years of prison at most and a 108 dollar fine. But in China, counterfeiters can be sentenced to death. The implementation of inspection groups and the deployment of a prevention force allow detecting more effectively counterfeiters and dismantling the various counterfeiter networks. Among the various available prevention forces, customs are the most involved and responsible for 90% of confiscation of all kinds of counterfeiting in Europe and 70% worldwide\nThe counterfeiting of drugs, and especially that of antibiotics is a true public health issue."

    "text": "In module 1, we discussed the history of antibiotic discovery and the current challenges with antimicrobial resistance that has been amplified by the lack of development of new antibiotics. In this module, we will examine the scientific and economic challenges associated with antibiotic development, and compare and contrast strategies that have been proposed to stimulate development of new antibiotics.\nAntibiotic discovery began to slow in the 1980’s leading to a discovery void in new molecular entities (NMEs) since the 1990s. This lack of antibiotic innovation occurred at a critical period when antibiotic resistance, particularly to many front-line beta-lactam antibiotics, began to increase rapidly due to the emergence and worldwide diffusion of new forms of enzymatic (beta-lactamase) resistance to antibiotics Figure 1. These bacterial enzymes can be broadly classified as:\n\nNarrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, which act on penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins (e.g., TEM-1 and 2, SHV-1, cephalosporinases, OXA-type enzymes\nExtended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), which act on penicillins and all four generations of cephalosporins (SHV-2, SHV-5, SHV-7, SHV-12, TEM-10, TEM-12, TEM-26, CTX-M, OXA-type ESBLs)\nCarbapenemases, which act on penicillins, all four generations of cephalosporins, and carbapenems (KPC, NDM-1, VIM and IMP carbapenemases, OXA-type carbapenemases).\n\nThe emergence and rapid spread of these beta-lactamases was problematic because they have a low barrier for mutation and creating resistance to new beta-lactams that are used as first and second line therapies for common respiratory, abdominal, and genital-urinary tract infect infections. Additionally, many of these enzymes are encoded on spread on plasmids (mobile genetic elements that can be passed from one bacterial species to another) that harbour additional resistance mechanisms to other classes resulting in rapid dissemination of multidrug resistance. \n\n\n\nFigure 1: Increase in numbers of group 1, 2, and 3 beta-lactamases from 1970 to 2009\n\n\nIn 2017, the World health Organization (WHO) convened a group of experts to prioritize the need for new drugs to treat antibiotic- resistant bacteria Table 1. The WHO assigned the highest priority to antibacterial drug research and development for the Gram- negative bacteria Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and species of Enterobacterales that are resistant to carbapenems and are usually extensively drug resistant (XDR).\n\n\nTable 1: WHO priority pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nPathogens included\n\n\n\n\nCritical\nAcinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem-resistant)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Carbapenem-resistant)\nEnterbacterales (3rd generation cephalosporin, carbapenem-resistant)\n\n\nHigh\nEnterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant\nHelicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant\nCampylobacter, fluoroquinolone-resistant\nSalmonella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\nMedium\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-non-susceptible\nHaemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant\nShigella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\n\n\nThe same year, the WHO released a clinical pipeline report, which was updated most recently in 2021. The report analysed antibiotics and biologics in development according to their activity against the critical priority pathogens carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA), extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). The level of innovation in the global clinical pipeline was assessed on the basis or the absence of pre-existing cross-resistance to currently used antibacterial drugs. The key findings from this report were:\n\n\nThe clinical pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.\nIt is primarily driven by small- or medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with large pharmaceutical companies continuing to exit the field.\nEight new antibacterial agents have been approved since 1 July 2017, but overall, they have limited clinical benefits.\nOne new anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) agent, pretomanid, developed by a not-for-profit organization, has been approved for use within a set drug-combination treatment for MDR TB.\nThe current clinical pipeline contains 50 antibiotics and combinations (with a new therapeutic entity) and 10 biologicals, of which 32 antibiotics are active against the WHO priority pathogens:\n\nSix of these agents address at least one of the innovation criteria; only two of these are active against the critical MDR Gram-negative bacteria.\nMore than 40% of the pipeline targeting WHO priority pathogens consists of additional beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLI) combinations, with a major gap in activity against metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers.\nThe anti-TB and Clostridium difficile antibacterial pipeline is more innovative than the WHO priority pathogens pipeline, with more than half of the antibiotics fulfilling all of the innovation criteria.\n\n\n\n The report confirms previous reports and highlights the public health implications of a drying antibiotic pipeline. In the following sections we will explore the causes and potential solutions to this crises.\nIn an analysis by the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP)[16], three key barriers in LMICs were identified that affect access to newer antibiotics for resistant pathogens:"

    "text": "Why has antibiotic discovery faltered in recent years?\n\nScientific challenges\nDiscovering new antibiotics is inherently challenging. Antibiotics must attack multiple target bacterial species that change over time by developing resistance, and must reach effective concentrations in multiple body compartments [1]. The discoverer of a new antibiotic must guess what resistance problems will be a problem in 10 years, and bring drugs to market to overcome these challenges. This flexibility and risk is not encountered in other therapeutic areas such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperglycemia, or Alzheimer’s disease where the drugs bind to one specific target. Even for cancer chemotherapy, which develops resistance to therapy, the mechanisms leading to resistance are not transmissible to other cancers or patients. Antibiotics must also be remarkably non-toxic, as their daily dosages often measured in grams are often higher that for other pharmaceutics measured in milligrams.\nNearly all of the antibiotics used today belong to classes of drugs discovered before 1970. They are products of a “golden age” of antibiotic discovery from 1945-1965, which screened natural products from soil streptomyces and fungi. This discovery approach hit the law of diminishing returns by the 1960’s with the same classes being constantly rediscovered[1]. Put simply, the low-hanging fruit for new antibiotic discovery has already been picked. Since 1970, the only new antibiotic classes to reach the marked are the oxazolidinediones (i.e. linezolid discovered in 1978 launched in 2000) and lipopeptides (discovered in 1986 launched in 2003).\nMost new antibiotics introduced since the 1970s have come through improvements of existing antibiotic classes yielding analogues with increased potency and greater ability to evade existing resistance. However, over time this approach has become more difficult with the emergence of more potent resistance mechanisms that affect multiple antibiotic classes.\nGiven the the limits of existing strategies of screening soil organisms, the pharmaceutical industry turned to genomics-based high-throughput antibiotic discovery strategies with considerable enthusiasm in the 1990s [1]. This discovery strategy used genomic sequence data from several target bacterial pathogens to identify conserved genes encoding targets not found in mammalian cells, and then ran high-throughput inhibition screens of existing chemical compound libraries to identify “druggable” molecules for these identified targets.\nDespite early enthusiasm and huge financial investments by many pharmaceutical companies, very few potential new antibiotic targets were identified and even fewer drugs entered into clinical development. An example of the scientific challenge is illustrated by experience of SmithKline Beecham (later purchased by Glaxo Smith Kline-one of the few large pharmaceutical companies still involved in antibiotic discovery (inset box). Indeed, only four major pharmaceutical companies still have active antibiotic research programmes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disappointment of genomics in antibiotic development\n\n\n\nFrom 1995 to 2002, SmithKline Beecham (now part of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) identified 300 potential targets and ran 67 high-throughput screens, each of 260000 –530000 compounds. Sixteen screens led to ‘hits’—meaning compounds that bound selectively to a target giving a reproducible positive signal in the assays—and five of these translated into ‘lead’ compounds. Of the five corresponding targets, two (FabI9 and Mrs) were not universally essential or conserved, meaning that they could not form the targets of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and it proved impossible to incorporate ‘drug-like properties’ into molecules that bound two others. The final target identified was peptide deformylase, for which GSK now has a molecule (GSK 1322322) in Phase II trials, although this did not come from high-throughput screening. This performance appears typical of other companies that followed the genomics strategy. Thus, 20 years after its advent, no antibiotic developed by this approach has reached the market [2].\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotic regulatory hurdles\nThe goal of regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is to review the potential benefits and risks to ensure that new drugs that make it to market are both safe and effective for patients in need. Still, a drug that gains FDA approval may give pause to European reviewers, despite having reviewed the same evidence as their American counterparts, and vice versa. Both the FDA and the EMA and AMA have distinct processes with different methods of endpoint evaluation, and individual comfort levels with risk. Other countries, such as India and China and many LMICs have their own processes for drug registration and approval and may require additional studies in populations of patients from their countries prior to approval. Therefore, if a new antibiotic that is effective for treating MDR pathogens is approved in one country, there is no guarantee that the drug will be favourable reviewed or available in other countries.\nLess than 10% of LMICs have access to “newly- approved” antibiotics within 10 years of availability, due to low probability expectation [3]. Indeed, The majority of the world’s annual 5.7 million antibiotic-treatable deaths occur in LMICs where the mortality burden from treatable bacterial infections far exceeds the estimated annual 700,000 deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections [4].\nHowever, even among HIC, patient access to new antibacterials is limited in countries such as Canada, Japan, and many European countries [5]. Companies appear to eschew antibacterial markets not offering attractive commercial prospects, which are almost all markets currently. If truly innovative antibacterials, like those identified by WHO, cannot find profitable markets then they may never be introduced into clinical practice despite the medical need.\nLMICs with limited drug regulatory capacity may loose control of antibiotic distribution. As a result, some antibiotics that should be reserved as last-line treatment options are sold without a prescription. Limited regulatory capacity may also lead to rampant availability of sub-standard and falsified antibiotic products, which further promote the emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.\nA company seeking regulatory approval to sell a new prescription antibiotic must complete a five-step process Figure 2: discovery/concept, preclinical research (animal testing), clinical research, regulatory review, and post-market safety monitoring. The cost to achieve this regulatory approval for antibiotics has been estimated between 1-1-5 billion dollars[6].\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pathway from drug discovery to regulatory approval and estimated costs. ADMET- studies to document drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination, and toxicity in animals. PK/PD pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic relationships- i.e. dose response and toxicity relationships from animals\n\n\nThe two most expensive components for antibiotics are the drug discovery (due to the higher failure rate) and clinical trials. Current guidance published by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requires randomized controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the new antibiotic to established therapies. This has to be complemented by the enrollment of a large number of patients to support the marketing application (New Drug Application NDA or Marketing Authorization Application MAA, respectively) for 1 or more infection site–specific indication (e.g., complicated urinary tract infection or complicated intra-abdominal infection), based on the drug’s clinical efficacy and safety. The bacterial pathogens relevant to the indication listed in the prescribing information are a secondary consideration based on the spectrum of activity of the investigational antibiotic and the microbiological efficacy data extracted from the clinical trials[7]. As a result, even if a new antibiotic is developed for a MDR pathogen, it is difficult to perform clinical studies and receive approval from the FDA or EMA for the treatment of a resistant infection.\n\n\nNon-inferiority trial designs\nThere are two kinds of clinical trials in which all pharmaceutical products must show which individuals can benefit from the product. They should also demonstrate a way to identify those individuals and document the benefit received from the product. Clear answers to these questions are required for product approval and acceptance. To achieve this, one of two types of trial designs can be used:\n\nA superiority trial – the goal of this is to show that the new agent is measurably superior to existing treatments or to a placebo.\nA non-inferiority (NI) trial – Sometimes formerly referred to as an “equivalence trial”, the goal of this is to show that the agent has efficacy similar (within the bounds of a pre-specified non-inferiority margin) to that of existing treatments. The concept of a non-inferiority trial is somewhat challenging to understand [8].\n\nA unique aspect of registration trials for antibiotics are that they are typically a non-inferiority design for a specific indication: e.g., complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI), complicated intraabdominal infection (cIAI), hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HABP/VAP). “Complicated” has different meaning depending on the disease state but essentially implies higher risk of treatment failure or relapse. Antibiotics cannot be typically approved or registered for a specific pathogen or resistance pattern, therefore any data on the efficacy of a novel antibiotic for resistant pathogens is typically inferred from preclinical laboratory and animal studies.\nFrom a public health perspective, new antimicrobial agents with an improved microbiological spectrum of activity should be developed before widespread bacterial resistance emerges. This desire leads to a paradox: although it is easy to demonstrate that a novel test agent has an improved spectrum both in vitro and in preclinical animal infection models, rigorous demonstrations of the new agent’s superior clinical efficacy over existing drugs is difficult to implement on a routine basis in trials of human infections:\nThere are two main aspects that influence the choice of non-inferiority design when planning clinical trials:\n\nThe first is related to ethical considerations. If there is an existing treatment which is life-saving or prevents serious harm to the patient for a given disease, it is not ethical to use placebo treatment in a comparative trial; consequently the comparison has to be done to an active control.\nThe second aspect is that in many therapeutic areas the increase in efficacy of new drugs is minor but very often these drugs have improved safety profiles and cost-benefit ratios.\n\nThese situations lead to trials where the primary objective is not to show superiority of a new drug compared to existing therapies, but to show that the new drug is not “worse” than the existing therapy.\nIf we define “not worse” as “better than control minus a specific margin”, then we end up in a non-inferiority trial.\nThe effect of the treatment can be established by showing that the lower bound of the 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval (equivalent to a 2-sided 95% confidence interval) of C-T is either above zero or above M Figure 3. Establishing non-inferiority margin M is one of the challenges of non-inferiority trials, the other is to establish Assay Sensitivity (AS). The margin M should be chosen as the largest clinically acceptable loss in efficacy and may depend on the medical indication of the drug. In most trials this margin is chosen to be of fixed size and is determined in advance. Antibiotic treatment success rates of 80% or more are common and thus acceptable loss in efficacy is usually 10-15%. Non-inferiority trials primarily aim to establish that at worst a clinically acceptable decrement in efficacy between a standard and experimental therapy could exist, expressed as a non-inferiority margin of Δ. Any trade-off in efficacy might potentially be compensated by decreased toxicity, more convenience, lower cost, and/or a broader (or narrower) spectrum of activity.\nWhat constitutes a fair non-inferiority margin (Δ) is often a matter of debate and typically established with the regulatory agency (e.g., US FDA, EMA) before the trial is started. For life-threatening illness, caregivers may find the prospect of any decrement in efficacy unconscionable unless clearly outweighed (or at minimum counterbalanced) by improved safety and tolerability. Serial application of non.inferiority margins could theoretically lead to creeping erosion of the control referent if each standard bearer is progressively (albeit slightly) less active than its predecessor- a phenomena known as “biocreep.” Establishing non-inferiority in serious but treatable infections should only be considered a prelude to finding effective treatments for similar populations suffering from refractory pathogens. Non-inferiority trials serve as an initial strategic bridge to more antibiotic choices when acceptably safe and reliably efficacious therapy is lacking. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Possible results of non-inferiority trials demonstrated by 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. Five distinct outcomes of non-inferiority studies are diagrammed using 2-sided 95% confidence intervals. The null hypothesis for the study is that the experimental treatment is inferior to the standard comparator, leaving non-inferiority of the new treatment as the alternate hypothesis if the null hypothesis is rejected. Failure to reject the null hypothesis does not necessarily imply that the alternate hypothesis has been excluded. The specific point estimate within limits does not alter the qualitative conclusion. On the other hand, both the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval can provide critical information depending on the circumstances. Each panel indicates the appropriate interpretation (A–E). Figure is from DiNubile et al. [9].\n\n\n Despite the high risk and high cost for development of a new antibiotic, the returns are relatively poor Figure 4. Meanwhile, industry analysts estimate that the average revenue generated from an antibiotic’s sale is roughly $46 million per year [6]. Therefore a key problem for antibiotics is that their development is not profitable. Companies are making more money from the sales of other drug classes, including immuno-oncology therapeutics, that antibiotic development projects compare poorly when management allocates capital.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Profitability of the antibiotic sector vs. other drug types. Source: McKenna et al [10].\n\n\nMoreover, it is difficult for an antibiotic manufacturer to be able to precisely identify the small proportion of patients who both really need the antibiotic for a MDR pathogen and are willing to pay a high price for the drug [11].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotics and the profitability problem.\n\n\n\nAs older antibiotics are still effective for treating most infections, the primary value of new antibiotics is to treat multidrug-resistant infections and provide a protective benefit against emerging pathogens. The duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients is relatively short (for example, 1–2 weeks or up to a month), whereas the treatment for chronic conditions can be continuous over many years. Resistance is hastened by use, new antibiotics are stewarded as a last resort, which results in low unit sales. Whereas medicines for rare diseases have used high unit-pricing strategies to achieve profitability, these are often unavailable to antibiotic developers due to clinical trial design (it is difficult to demonstrate the superiority of new antibiotics as resistance is still relatively uncommon) and bundled hospital reimbursement structures (whereby hospitals are incentivized to prescribe lower-cost antibiotics). Large pharmaceutical companies have largely abandoned the market, accounting for only 4 of the 42 antibiotics currently under development [12]. Any investment in a new antibiotic is seen as a high-risk proposition, and consequently the returns expected by prospective investors are high to account for this risk premium. This in turn puts pressure on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as there is little chance that their candidate -antibiotics will be purchased by larger companies.\n\n\nEnormous costs are incurred once an antibiotic is approved. Approval by regulatory agencies is usually contingent on performing many studies post approval (phase IV): pediatric dosing and safety studies, pharmacokinetic studies in special populations (i.e. elderly, obese, dialysis), pharmacovigelance (safety), development and validation of susceptibility testing technology, manufacturing and supply chain investments, anda 5-10 years commitment to monitor resistance through antimicrobial surveillance studies. Recouping these costs may be impossible for drugs with activity against MDR pathogens as many many countries and health systems will negotiate the lowest possible price for purchase and then (appropriately) restrict the use of the antibiotic to preserve its effectiveness- resulting in low sales. This is completely different from a scenario of a new “breakthrough” cancer therapy, where the drug will be immediately incorporated in treatment.\nWhile the high post-approval costs may be absorbable by large pharmaceutical companies with other profitable drug products in other therapeutic areas, they can put smaller companies out of business. As novel antibiotics are held in reserve for years, sales revenues are very low in the first 5–7 years. During this period, the company must pay for the high post-approval costs described above that for antibiotics cannot be covered through aggressive sales. For antibiotics, companies have no way to pay for them without positive net revenues in an environment that hinders their ability to raise additional funds. especially if the approved drug was developed for MDR pathogens as illustrated by the Archeogen company:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study: The Failure of Achaogen\n\n\n\nAchaogen was a small pharmaceutical company that first advanced plazomicin (Zemdri), a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibacterial, into the clinic in 2009. Despite initial plans to develop the drug as a much-needed new treatment for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) — which included drug-resistant Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli — a phase III trial that started in 2014 in this setting struggled to recruit patients. The company pivoted to initiate a phase III trial in complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs) in 2016, and submitted the drug for FDA approval in this indication and in bloodstream infections in 2017. Although plazomicin was approved for cUTIs in 2018, the FDA rejected its use in the potentially more lucrative and important bloodstream infections despite evidence of improved outcomes in patients with carbapenem-resistant infections. An independent advisory committee also voted against approval in the bloodstream, noting that the efficacy signal came from a small study of just 28 patients. In the end, Achaogen spent 15 years and a billion dollars to win FDA approval for Zemdri, a drug for hard-to-treat UTIs. In July, the World Health Organization added plazomicin to its list of essential new medicines. Achaogen later filed for bankruptcy, less than a year after the FDA approved its lead product.

    "text": "What are the current strategies to incentive antibiotic development?\nIncentives for antibiotics are categorized as either ‘push’ or ‘pull’Figure 5. Push incentives occur before regulatory approval by the FDA or EMA, and the funding supports many projects, including the many that fail before approval. Pull incentives are paid only after regulatory approval and hence only successful products are supported. Both push and pull incentives are required to address the lack of antibiotic development.\nMany successful initiatives to establish push funding for antibiotics have been developed over the last decade. At present, major AMR development initiatives include:\n\nUS Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, BARDA (1.2 billion dollars to support Phase 2/3 antibiotic development against 21st century threats including drug-resistant bacteria, supports CARB-X)\nCARB-X (550 million, Hits to lead Phase 1 product development of therapeutics, diagnostics and preventatives against WHO and CDC priority drug-resistant bacteria)\nThe Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, GARDP (Produce discovery from discovery to delivery including novel therapeutics, optimizing antibiotics, developing combinations. Focused on WHO priority list).\nThe European Gram Negative AntiBacterial Engine, ENABLE\nNovo Holdings REPAIR Impact Fund (165 million investment in lead optimization to Phase I development of therapeutics and diagnostics against WHO priority drug-resistant bacteria.)\nJoint Programming Initiative on Antimicrobial Resistance, JPIAMR> (novel therapeutics, diagnostics, surveillance, prevention, stewardship, WHO priority pathogens\nWellcome Trust (175 million drug-resistant infections focused on policy, strengthening evidence for action, clinical trial capabilities and innovative product development including CARB-X\nInnovative Medicines Initiative\nAMR Action Fund. WHO, European Investment Bank, and Wellcome Trust\nUK AID (315 million pounds funded through the Global AMR innovation fund and the Fleming Fund to help LMICs tackle AMR).\nThe German Federal Ministry of Education and Research support of national research programs as well as contributions to international initiatives like CARB-X, GARDP, and JPIAMR.\nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation (124 million targeting drug-resistant infections in low-middle income countries (LMICs), disease surveillance, vaccine development, economic modeling, and CARB-X\nU.S. National Institutes of Health (1.4 billion dollars funding basic research, academic industry startup partnerships, and other research and development against bacterial threats, for vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics\n\nThese push efforts are helping. The preclinical pipeline is shifting to higher quality products targeting the most urgent clinical needs, de-risking projects for private development. Without these programmes, the fragile pipeline would become entirely moribund. However, the bankruptcy of Achaogen in April 2019 provided a wake-up clarity for the antibiotics industry: the finish line is not FDA or EMA approval, but break-even profitability. For Achaogen, scientific and regulatory achievement ended in economic disaster. A similar fate awaits other antibiotic companies unless governments enact meaningful pull incentives in the next year.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Push versus pull incentives for antibiotic development\n\n\nPull incentives are increasing the focus of of new initiatives to develop antibiotics in the United States and Europe, building on the release of the DRIVE-AB final report in 2018. Clearly, effective pull funding will require substantial public investment that may not be politically popular if viewed as a large cash “handout” to pharmaceutical companies. Yet, some novel reimbursement schemes with pull incentives for antibiotic development are starting in the US, UK and Europe (recently reviewed by Gotham et al. [13].\nOne of the most frequently discussed pull incentives is the “Netflix reimbursement model” ?@fig-netflixmodel that is currently being implemented as a pilot project in the UK and Sweden. This payment mechanism is called ‘de-linkage’ model because it separates the payments to manufacturers from the number of units sold.\n\n\n{{< video https://www.ft.com/video/adada10f-5747-4976-a3e0-958b0165e0ef>}}\nFigure 6: European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) video on developing TB vaccines\n\n\n::: {#fig-netflixmodel}\n\n\n\nFinancial Times video examining the “Netflix Model” of pull incentives for antibiotic reimbursement. The Financial Times has also produced a special report on the Future Health of Antibiotics. :::\n\nHow can the true value of antibiotics be better communicated to the public? Two leading experts in antimicrobial resistance (Drs. John Rex and Ken Outterson) have suggested that antibiotics should be thought of more like the “fire-extinguishers” of medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntibiotics: Medicine’s Fire Extinguishers\n\n\n\nNo one wakes up hoping they get to use a fire extinguisher that day. Not even the fire department. Fire fighters go to work every day and hope they don’t get any calls. They perform regular maintenance on all their gear and stay at the station 24/7 just as a precaution. We pay them to be available and prepared so they can come to our rescue when we need them. If we didn’t pay for the fire department for years and then a fire broke out in the middle of your town, can you imagine the damage? People would die unnecessarily, the medical system would be overwhelmed, and the fire could spread beyond the borders of the town. The fire might rage through the whole county, then the region, and then your entire country. It might even spread through the entire world, just like COVID-19.   A fire fighter uses a hose to subdue flames engulfing a home while a physician uses antibiotics to stop an infection in your body. We need to be prepared for fires – the flame kind and the medical kind. As a society, we are prepared for the flame kind. But the medical? We aren’t even close.  Without antibiotics, all of modern medicine will change worldwide. Diseases we think of only being in the history books could become a part of every day life again. Minor surgery could become life threatening. An infected cut on your hand could be the end. Childbirth will easily endanger the lives of mothers and newborns. Cancer treatments will be nearly impossible. Antibiotics are vitally important to all of humanity”.   -John Rex, M.D., AMR Solutions\n\n\n\n For more information on how AMR risks can be responsibly and effectively communicated to the public, see this excellent video prepared by the Wellcome Trust: Drug-resistant infections: the power of language."

Antibiotics, which may be available without prescription, are often used as substitutes for clean food, clean water, vaccines and diagnostics. Therefore, it will be impossible to address the challenges of antimicrobial resistance and lack of access to antibiotic therapy if other contributing factors are not addressed.\nFor countries where antibiotics can be accessed without a prescription, controlling antibiotic distribution should be highly prioritized. However, introduction of a new prescription system when antibiotic demand is still high can lead to unintentional consequences (such as the distribution of antibiotics on the black market) making inappropriate antibiotic use even harder to control. It is important to note that the overuse of antibiotics has become a social norm in many countries as it is influenced by the beliefs and attitudes of the individuals towards antibiotics as well as sociocultural factors, regardless of medical justifications [15].\nAntibiotic use is generally higher in the developed world, but LMICs are rapidly catching up as access to healthcare improves and the burden of antibiotic-treatable infections remains high. Between 2000 and 2015,the global rate of antibiotic consumption increased by 39%, from 11.3 to 15.7 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 inhabitants per day. In LMICs, the consumption rate for cephalosporins,quinolones, and macrolides has increased by 399%, 125%, and 119%, respectively, while in high-income countries (HICs), consumption has decreased by 18%, 1%, and 25%, respectively."

Although AMR cannot be eliminated, many factors can be addressed to improve the scientific and economic environment for restoring health to the antibiotic pipeline. Antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention must therefore be pursued alongside improvements in access to antibiotics in LMICs. All stakeholders—international bodies, government leaders, health and agriculture ministries, patients and medical practitioners, farmers and veterinarians, academia, and the pharmaceutical industry— must slow the emergence of resistance to existing antibiotics to ensure affordability and access everywhere."

    "text": "Until the 20th Century, influenza and pneumonia, tuberculosis, and enteric infections were among the top three causes of death. The average life expectancy of an adult in Western Europe was approximately 50 years, and 2% of children failed to live beyond age 5 because of premature deaths caused mostly by infectious diseases.\nIndustrialization and increasing wealth during the 19th century brought improvements in drinking water and sanitation in many countries, leading to reductions in communicable enteric infections and improvement in life expectancy Figure 1. By the early 20th century, vaccines for pertussis, diptheria, yellow fever and tuberculosis were introduced. However, common bacterial infections remained a serious medical threat. Streptococcal throat infections were sometimes fatal, ear infections could progress to deafness, mastoiditis or meningitis. Minor surgeries were associated with risk of life-threatening infections. Maternal mortality during childbirth approached 2%.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Changes in life expectancy over 500 years.\n\n\nAntibacterial resistance pre-dates the medical use of antibiotics and is estimated to have emerged with bacteria on earth approximately 2-2.5 billion years ago. In contrast, the first humans are believed to have existed around 2 million years ago. The first recorded use of antimicrobial -like substances was by the early Egyptians, Greeks, and Chinese, who used natural products with antimicrobial activity for millennia to treat wounds and infections, even if the causes of these diseases were unknown until the 19th and 20th century. Therefore, antibiotic resistance was not created by humans and misuse of antibiotic inevitable-it is a biologic certainty and evolutionary destiny.\nThe microbiologist and immunologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915) (Figure 2) is credited with the discovery and first medical application of a synthetic antibiotic arsphenamine (Salvarsan) for the treatment of a bacterial infection-syphilis. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1909.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: German immunologist Paul Ehrlich (1854-1915). Image: Library of Congress\n\n\nYet it was the serendipitous discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Alexander Fleming (Figure 3) and its subsequent purification of the drug in quantities needed for clinical testing by Drs. Florey and Chain in the 1930s, that initiated the true start of the modern antibiotic era. Alexander Fleming was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1945.\nInterestingly, the term antibiotic was actually coined by Selman Waksman, a biochemist and microbiologist who discovered the first effective treatment for tuberculosis, streptomycin, and was awarded the Nobel prize in 1952.\nAlexander Fleming was among the first physicians to caution about the risks of resistance to penicillin if used too little or for a too short of period during treatment. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, Dr. Fleming noted:\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sir Alexander Flemming (1881-1955). Image: Imperial War Museum\n\n\n\n\n“It is not difficult to make microbes resistant to penicillin in the laboratory by exposing them to concentrations not sufficient to kill them, and the same thing has occasionally happened in the body. The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to non-lethal quantities of the drug make them resistant.”   -Sir Alexander Fleming, Nobel Prize Lecture, December 11, 1945\n\n By 1947, Fleming’s predictions had come true as the first cases of penicillin resistance were already being reported. Thus began the modern era’s “arms race” between new antibiotic discovery and increasing antimicrobial resistance.\nInitially, antibiotic discovery seemed to keep pace with resistance as a host of new chemical classes were developed and introduced in the 1950s-1980’s. For the first half of the century, the repeated and successful response to emerging resistance was to discover new antibiotics [1].\nYet by the 1980’s, the discovery of new agents began to slow and this strategy began to fail Figure 4. The last truly “new” antibiotic class discovered that reached the market was in 1987. Since then, there has been a lack of innovation in the field, and today there are few novel antibiotic classes in the drug pipeline.\nIn Module 2 we will examine the scientific challenges and market forces that have made new antibiotic discovery increasingly difficult and how access to newer antibiotics is limited in many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Antibiotic discovery timeline. Source: www.reactgroup.org\n\n\nOnce antibiotic resistance develops, it can spread from one colonised patient to another patient if appropriate hygienic precautions (e.g., hand hygiene, isolation) are not followed. The risk of resistant bacteria spreading is enhanced in crowded environments, especially when people in the surrounding area are receiving antibiotics - a common scenario in hospitals in wards of critically-ill patients.\nThe consequences of faltering antibiotic discovery are now being felt worldwide as more and more bacterial infections are becoming harder to treat. Especially worrisome is the lack of antibiotics against common Gram-negative bacteria (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) that are increasingly resistant to all but last-line antibiotics. The rapid global spread of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria, also known in the lay press as “superbugs,” can cause infections that are not treatable with existing antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow quickly can antibiotics develop resistance?\n\n\n\nClick this link to watch a YOUTUBE video of how quickly Escherichia coli and develop resistance to ciprofloxacin.

    "text": "Global response to antimicrobial resistance\nRecognizing the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance (AMR) on human health but also the economy and human development, The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) developed in 2001 a Global Plan for Containment of Antimicrobial Resistance that subsequently led to a Global Action Plan for AMR in 2017 and more recently a “Call to Action on Antimicrobial Resistance” in 2021. The plan outlines 21 strategies and 5 strategic objectives action plans that should be implemented in member states to address AMR. These include:\n\nImprovements in the awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training\nStrengthening of knowledge and evidence base of AMR through surveillance and research\nReductions in the incidence of infection through effective sanitation, hygiene and infection prevention measures\nOptimization the use of antimicrobial medicines in human and animal health\nDevelopment of an economic case for sustainable investment in AMR research that takes account of the needs of all countries, and increase investment in new medicines, diagnostic tools, vaccines and other interventions\n\nOne aspect of this action plan was the development of Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS). A link the 2022 report can be here\nThe WHO also proposed a Priority Pathogen List for research and development of new antibiotics and established a global antimicrobial use and surveillance program. This list includes bacterial pathogens that are considered to be be the biggest threat to human health in addition to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The WHO list breaks down pathogens into three groups:\n\n\nTable 1: WHO priority pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nPathogens included\n\n\n\n\nCritical\nAcinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem-resistant)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Carbapenem-resistant)\nEnterbacterales (3rd generation cephalosporin, carbapenem-resistant)\n\n\nHigh\nEnterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant\nHelicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant\nCampylobacter, fluoroquinolone-resistant\nSalmonella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\nMedium\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-non-susceptible\nHaemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant\nShigella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\n\n\nThese pathogens may exhibit multi-drug resistance (MDR), extensive drug resistance (XDR) or pan-drug resistance (PDR) [2]. Difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR) is a newer definition used to define isolate resistance patterns that require the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics- e.g., Acinetobacter baumanii susceptible only to colistin and tobramycin [3].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do these resistance definitions mean?\n\n\n\nThe resistance definitions used by the WHO have specific meanings.\n\nMDR-resistance to one agent in at least 3 antibiotic categories\nXDR-resistant except to 2 or fewer antibiotic categories\nPDR-resistant to all agents in all antibiotic categories\nDTR-requires the use of less-effective or more toxic “reserve” antibiotics\n\n\n\nCurrently, both the WHO and OIE have also developed lists of antibiotics that are considered of “critical importance” for human and animal medicine. These lists help establish priorities for antimicrobial resistance surveillance and new drug development."

    "text": "What are the drivers of antimicrobial resistance?\nAMR is a natural phenomenon. Most antimicrobial drugs are naturally produced by micro-organisms, including environmental fungi and saprophytic bacteria, or are synthetic modifications of these natural products, with only a few drugs (e.g., sulphonamides and fluoroquinolones) being wholly synthetic. Yet AMR selection is accelerated by antimicrobial exposure in health care, agriculture, and the environment. Further transmission is affected by standards of infection control in healthcare settings, sanitation, access to clean water, access to assured quality antimicrobials and diagnostics, travel, and migration.\nAntimicrobials are among the most commonly prescribed drugs used in human medicine, yet up to 50% of all antimicrobials prescribed to people are considered unnecessary. This use, misuse, or overuse of antimicrobial drugs is considered to be a major driving force towards antimicrobial resistance. Globally, the use of antimicrobials is accelerating worldwide, particularly in LMICs, as antimicrobials become readily accessible and affordable. The use of WHO Watch antibiotics increased 90.0% worldwide and 165% in LMICs between 2000 and 2015.\nIn medicine, the concentration of antibiotic prescribing might be highest in inpatient settings, with 30–40% of patients on antibiotics in European hospitals. However, the overall highest quantity of antimicrobial consumption is highest in the community setting.\nYet, more antimicrobials are used in food production than in human beings, with marked national differences in the number of antimicrobial drugs used in food producing animals as shown in Figure 5. It has been estimated that 73% of all antibiotic use per by weight is for food production in animals [4]. Various studies have shown that antimicrobial resistance has, at least in part, emerged as a result of the selective pressure exerted by antimicrobial use outside of human medicine, namely in veterinary medicine, food-animal and fish production, and agriculture. Therefore to effectively AMR, a multifaceted or ONE-HEALTH approach is required.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Modifiable risk factors that drive antimicrobial resistance. Figure form Homes et al. [5]."

    "text": "AMR in Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs)\nAMR is a global problem, but its prevalence across the globe varies with antibiotic consumption, access to clean water and adequate sanitation, vaccination coverage, and access to quality healthcare. The latest WHO report, based on AMR data from 66 countries, illustrates an alarming picture of the global status of AMR as an increasing number of countries are now reporting high rates of resistance among antimicrobials used to treat common infections.\nThere are considerable knowledge gaps regarding AMR prevalence in LMICs that lack clinical and laboratory capacity and surveillance infrastructure. A systematic review of 144 16 studies across Africa lacked AMR data for approximately 40% of the African countries. In the Asia and Pacific region, South East Asia is estimated to have the highest risk of AMR emergence and spread, with the highly transferable New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) as an example. Furthermore, China and India alone accounted for more than one-third of the global incidence of 17 multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis [6].\nCOVID-19 has focused global attention on the inequitable access to the tools needed to control the pandemic, with high-income countries (HICs) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at opposite ends of the scale. In the case of antibiotic resistance, a pandemic projected to cause four times more deaths per year than occurred from COVID-19 during 2020, inequity between HICs and LMICs is a major challenge [7]:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is Low-Middle-Income Country (LMIC) defined?\n\n\n\nThe World Bank defines lower middle income economies as countries where the per capita gross national income (GNI) falls between $1,026 and $3,955. The countries that are part of the upper MIC classification with a GNI that falls between $3,956 and $12,475.\nCountries currently included: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, China (People’s Republic of), Colombia, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, North Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Montserrat, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Niue, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Helena, Samoa, São Tomé and Príncipe, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, South, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sudan, Suriname, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tokelau, Tonga, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam, Wallis and Futuna, West Bank and Gaza Strip, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\n\nLMICs are particularly susceptible to the emergence and rapid spread of AMR for several reasons:\n\nHigh population density\nLack of access to clean water, suboptimal sewage systems, poor sanitation\nPoor healthcare infection control practices\nIncreasing consumption of antimicrobials in humans\nAvailability and distribution of poor-quality (counterfeit) medicines\nLack of regulation on antimicrobial use in farming, and pharmaceutical industry pollution\n\nThe health and economic impact of AMR is also more severe and longer lasting in LMICs versus HICs. AMR is generally associated with:\n\nIncreased mortality and health costs\nAntibiotics effective against AMR are more expensive and not affordable for many patients\nIncreasing use of antibiotics with efficacy against AMR leads to higher resistance to “last-line” antibiotics Figure 6.\nIn fact, carbapenem consumption is increasing at a rapid pace in poor economies [8].\nLack of access to antibiotics in some poorer countries, a driver of mortality particularly in children under 5 years of age\nLack of access to newer, expensive antibiotics needed to treat the increasing toll of MDR and XDR bacterial infections\nInequity in ability to provide the basic public health interventions that drive many of the social determinants of infectious diseases in LMICs\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Global antibiotic use and resistance in (A) High-income countries versus (B) Low-income countries. Source: CDDEP [6].\n\n\nThe singular effectiveness of access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, called WASH, in preventing the spread of disease is well understood, yet billions of people around the world still lack access to these necessities [9].\n\nCurrently, 2.1 billion people live without access to safe drinking water and 4.5 billion people are without access to adequate sanitation.\nEvery day, 1300 children under 5 die from preventable diarrhoeal diseases, including cholera, caused by contaminated water and poor sanitation.\n1 in 3 healthcare facilities lacks soap and water or hand sanitizer where staff provide patient care. Billions of patients worldwide must rely on these facilities.\nIn some countries, up to 90% of women receive routine prophylactic antibiotics during childbirth, highlighting the conditions under which they are delivering their babies and what would cause the inevitability of infection\n\nThe cumulative lack of WASH adds up to children and adults not only getting unnecessarily sick—with the associated suffering, medical costs and loss of income or schooling—they are relying on antibiotics to get better [10]. The challenge here is that WASH is a public works solution for a public health problem. WASH is not a pill or ‘quick fix’. It requires capital investment, system strengthening, and behaviour change to ensure that clean water and functional toilets are available and utilized day-in and day-out. These issues require a different set of skills than those possessed by medical and public health professionals.\nIn LMICs, an estimated 670 million people still practice open defaecation in 2017, and only one in three people have access to safe drinking water, resulting in high rates of diarrheal disease and equally large amounts of inappropriate antibiotic use [10]. According to WHO surveys, vaccination, a cornerstone of infection prevention and reducing the need for antibiotic use, is suboptimal in both HICs and LMICs. In 2019, global third-dose coverage for childhood pneumococcal vaccination in 149 member states was only 48%, and global rotavirus vaccine coverage was estimated at 39%. In South Africa, middle-income country, procures less than 1 million doses of influenza vaccine for its annual influenza season, despite in excess of 10 million people being identified as high-risk for influenza and prioritized for vaccination.\nOptimizing infection prevention on farms and making improvements to housing conditions and feed to reduce illness in animals is also critical in food production to offset the need for antibiotic growth promotion or metaphylaxis in food production animals. While there has been progress in the reduction of antibiotic use in farms in the EU and other HICs, attention nor funding for such improvements in LMICs has not even been proposed. “It’s one thing being told to reduce your antibiotic use in food production, it’s another to have the means to do so, even for the most committed resource-poor farmer.\nAs discussed above, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a complex phenomenon and is intensified by selective pressure through antibiotic use in humans, animals, and agriculture. The transmission of AMR to humans occurs from contact with animals (including food), other humans, and the environment. Transmission is facilitated by several factors, including high population density, lack of access to clean water, suboptimal sewage systems, poor sanitation, and poor healthcare infection control practices, all of which are more common in LMICs. With the increasing consumption of antimicrobials in humans, lack of regulation on antimicrobial use in farming, and pharmaceutical industry pollution, it may not be surprising that relatively higher levels of AMR among human pathogens are being reported from LMICs Figure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Drug resistance index (DRI) across countries. The drug resistance index is a composite score derived by multiplying the proportion of each antibiotic used to treat a set of pathogens by the proportion of all isolates that were resistant to that drug. Blue bars represent high-income countries (HICs) dark blue bars represent low-middle income countries (LMICs)[6].\n\n\nIn 2022, The Antibiotic Resistance Collaboration published an analysis of mortality rates associated with antibiotic resistance by country [11]. The authors estimated disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen–drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019. Data were obtainted from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. Predictive statistical modelling was used to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data Figure 8.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: All-age rate of deaths attributable to and associated with bacterial antimicrobial resistance by GBD region, 2019 Estimates were aggregated across drugs, accounting for the co-occurrence of resistance to multiple drugs. Error bars show 95% uncertainty intervals. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. Graph in from reference [11].\n\n\nThese data demonstrate a widening gap in the impact of antimicrobial resistance between HIC vs. LMICs.\nThe international focus on awareness, surveillance, infection prevention, stewardship and research and development (R&D) of new antibiotics may actually be widening the equity gap by pouring millions of dollars into R&D of new antibiotics and surveillance systems, while the intervention that could benefit LMICs the most, infection prevention, has received a relatively few resources.\n\nWhat are the possible solutions to address resistance inequality?\nRecently the COVID-19 pandemic has refocused attention that in infectious diseases The Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator that we will discuss in Model 2 has shown that financial contributions from HICs to a LMIC-pool can improve equitable access to diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines, but it is conceivable that the same model could be broadened to encompass tools that would support major social change for AMR.\n\n\nHow can the effectiveness of antimicrobials be preserved?\nStrategies for the prevention and containment of AMR often focus on:\n\nImprovement of infection diagnosis and prescription practices (antimicrobial stewardship)\nReduction of antimicrobial use in agriculture and environmental exposure in general\nDevelopment of new antimicrobials\nAccess to essential medicines of assured quality\nImprovement of AMR surveillance\n\nAntimicrobial stewardship is a coordinated program that promotes and focuses on the appropriate use of antimicrobials and strategies to improve patient outcomes, reduces antimicrobial resistance, and decrease the spread of infections caused by multidrug-resistant organisms Figure 9. These programs may be implemented through the use of institution-specific treatment guidelines and an antibiotic stewardship team (typically infectious diseases physicians with a clinical pharmacist) who carry out full-time activities to promote and encourage appropriate antibiotic use.\nWhile these programs have been shown to be successful Figure 10, many gaps remain in the knowledge of how to optimally design and sustain stewardship programs in the hospital, and such programs are rarely implemented in community settings where most antibiotic consumption takes place.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Examples of antimicrobial stewardship efforts\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Examples of antimicrobial stewardship outcomes\n\n\n\nWHO AWARE Antibiotic Classification\nSince 2017, the WHO has published the AWaRe Antibiotic Classification List to support antibiotic stewardship efforts at local, national and global levels. The classification takes into account the impact of different antibiotics and antibiotic classes on antimicrobial resistance, to emphasize the importance of their appropriate use.\nAntibiotics are classified into three groups: Access, Watch and Reserve.\n\nThe “Access” group includes antibiotics that have activity against a wide range of commonly encountered susceptible pathogens while also showing lower resistance potential than antibiotics in the other groups. Selected Access group antibiotics are recommended as essential first or second choice empiric treatment options for infectious syndromes reviewed by the Essential Medicines List (EML) Expert Committee and are listed as individual medicines on the Model Lists of Essential Medicines to improve access and promote appropriate use.\nThe “Watch” group includes antibiotic classes that have higher resistance potential and includes most of the highest priority agents among the Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine and/or antibiotics that are at relatively high risk of selection of bacterial resistance. These medicines should be prioritized as key targets of stewardship programs and monitoring. Selected Watch group antibiotics are recommended as essential first or second choice empiric treatment options for a limited number of specific infectious syndromes and are listed as individual medicines on the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines.\nThe “Reserve” group includes includes antibiotics and antibiotic classes that should be reserved for treatment of confirmed or suspected infections due to multi-drug-resistant organisms. Reserve group antibiotics should be treated as “last resort” options.\nSelected Reserve group antibiotics are listed as individual medicines on the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines when they have a favourable risk-benefit profile and proven activity against “Critical Priority” or “High Priority” pathogens identified by the WHO Priority Pathogens List1, notably carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae. These antibiotics should be accessible, but their use should be tailored to highly specific patients and settings, when all alternatives have failed or are not suitable. These medicines could be protected and prioritized as key targets of national and international stewardship programs involving monitoring and utilization reporting, to preserve their effectiveness.\nFinally, the list includes “not-recommended” antibiotics- fixed-dose combinations of multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics listed here is not evidence-based, nor recommended in high-quality international guidelines. WHO does not recommend their use in clinical practice.\n\nThe AWaRe tool is useful for monitoring antibiotic consumption, defining targets and monitoring the effects of stewardship policies that aim to optimize antibiotic use and curb antimicrobial resistance. The WHO 13th General Programme of Work 2019–2023 includes a country-level target of at least 60% of total antibiotic consumption being Access group antibiotics. Attainment rates of these consumption targets by country is currently reported in the GLASS surveillance system.\nIn December 2022, the the WHO published The WHO AWaRe (‎access, watch, reserve)‎ antibiotic book. The book provides “concise, evidence-based guidance on how to optimize use of antibiotics included on WHO’s Model Lists of Essential Medicines. It includes information on the choice of antibiotic, dose, route of administration, and duration of treatment for more than 30 of the most common clinical infections in children and adults in both primary health care and hospital settings.”\n\n\n\nDiagnostic stewardship\nInappropriate diagnostic testing can drive unnecessary antibiotic use and is considered an essential component in stewardship programs. In 2012, The American Board of Internal Medicine initiated the “Choosing Wisely” campaign design to educate both practitioners and patients about the importance of avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests.

Advani recently reviewed the use (and misuse) of this test [12].\nThe problems of urine dipstick testing were also discussed on the ID:IOTS podcast episode “Urinalysis paralysis.” The podcast is an entertaining and informative discussion by two UK-based infectious diseases physicians.

ASU started by trying to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in patients with 3 conditions: upper respiratory tract infections, especially common colds with sore throat; acute diarrhea and simple wounds.\nThe program focused on simple measures, compatibility with the providers’ values, advantages with respect to current practice; performing testable interventions, and transparency.\nIn the beginning, ASU consisted of a network of researchers from Thailand’s Ministry of Public Health and pharmacists and doctors from Srinakharinwirot University and Chulalongkorn University.\n\nIn phase 1 (2007- 2008) they piloted educational and training reforms to improve prescribing in 10 hospitals and 87 primary health centres in one province. Antibiotic prescription, provider attitudes of effectiveness and knowledge of antibiotics, non-prescription rates in case of non-bacterial infections, and patient health and satisfaction were monitored.\nIn phase 2 (2008-2009) the same indicators were then used to scale up the program to three provinces and two hospital networks, counting to 44 hospitals and 621 primary health care centres.\nThe 3rd phase (2010 – Present) is focusing on long-term sustainability and scale up of ASU – initially to 22 hospital networks in 15 provinces, and then subsequently across the entire country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\nPhase 1\n(1 year)\nPhase 2\n(1 year, 3 months)\nPhase 3,\ntransition period\n\n\n\n\nGoals\nTest effectiveness of ASU in changing antibiotic prescription behavior\nTest feasibility of scaling up ASU model\nStrengthen networks, assess scaling up mechanisms\n\n\nTarget\n1 province\n3 provinces and 2 networks of public and private hospitals\n22 hospital networks in 15 provinces\n\n\nFunding\nagencies\nWHO, Thai FDA\nHSRI, NHSO, Thai FDA\nDSMDC, Thai FDA\n\n\nCoordinating\nagencies\nThai FDA\nThai FDA\nDSMDC, Thai FDA, IHPP\n\n\nBudget spending\nUS$ 33,000\nUS$ 73,000\nUS$ 123,000\n\n\nSpillover effect\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nThe program also had many simple but innovative community health interventions. For example, holding up a simple concave mirror to consumers trying to buy antibiotics for treating the common cold and cough was part of a new initiative in Thailand by community pharmacists to lower consumption of antibiotics Figure 11.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Mirror toolkit for patients to self-assess their sore throat symptoms in Thai Pharmacies\n\n\nAfter completion of Phases 1-2, the following results were noted:\n\nPositive effects on reducing antibiotic prescribing. Antibiotic use was reduced by 18-46%\nThe percentage of patients who did not receive antibiotics increased by 29.1%, whereas there was no change in the control groups who were not involved in the ASU program\nPatient health and satisfaction rates were high, 96%-99.3% of patients surveyed who did not refeive antibiotics recovered and felt better within 7-10 days after their medical visits\nSuccess in scaling up. The number of hospitals adopting ASU increased from 44 hospitals (2008) to more than 600 hospitals (2010).\n\nThe ASU project is having an impact beyond the borders of Thailand too and is now seen as a model for replication in other parts of south-east Asia with interest elicited from as far away as Africa and Latin America.

For example, surveillance data from the European Centres for Disease Control (ECDC) have reported a dramatic increase in multidrug-resistance (MDR) in Italy since 2009, with now more than one-third of Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to previously-considered last-line antibiotics such as carbapenems Figure 12. An interactive ECDC resistance atlas showing differences in resistance rates between countries for common antibiotics can be found here. Similarly, the Italian Antimicrobial Surveillance system (Micronet Resistance Surveillance) has reported: that for 2021:\n\n23.8% of Escherichia coli are resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporins\n29.5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant to carbapenems (including 33.1% resistant to multiple drug classes)\n16.4% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are resistant to carbapenems\n86.9% of Acinetobacter spp. are resistant to carbapenems with 78.8% of species resistant to multiple drug classes\nFor the Gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus, the percentage of methicillin-resistant isolates (MRSA) remained stable, around 29.9%%, while a worrying trend continues to increase in the percentage of Enterococcus faecium isolates resistant to vancomycin, which in 2020 was equal at 28.2%\nFor Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a slight increase in both the percentage of isolates resistant to penicillin (9.7%).\nOverall, higher antimicrobial resistance rates (around 40%) are observed in ICUs versus general medical wards for both carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Regional differences in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) bloodstream infection- 2020 incidence per 100,000 residents in Italy.

    "text": "One-Health Perspective of AMR\nBecause the drivers of antimicrobial resistance lie in humans, animals, plants, food and the environment, a sustained One Health response is essential to engage and unite all health and environmental sectors around a shared vision and goals. “One Health” refers to designing and implementing programmes, policies, legislation and research in a way that enables multiple groups engaged in human, terrestrial and aquatic animal and plant health, food and feed production Figure 15 and the environment to communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes.\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Rationale for one-health model for addressing AMR. Source: WHO\n\n\n\nAntibiotic use in animal food production\nFew antimicrobial classes are reserved exclusively for humans Figure 15. The vast majority of antibiotics are used both in humans and animals, including domestic mammals, birds, farmed fish and shellfish, honeybees and others.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Dairy farmer administering antibiotics in UK. Source: Financial Times\n\n\nAs noted earlier, 73% of all antibiotic consumption per weight is used for food production in animals. Critically, two-third of all human infectious diseases that have emerged or re-emerged in recent decades are zoonotic-i.e. they originated in animals. Therefore the transmission of antibiotic resistance organisms from the foodchain to humans is a major health concern.\nIn horticulture, tetracyclines, streptomycin, and other antimicrobials are used for the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections that affect plants (e.g., fire blight Erwinea amylovora).\nIn veterinary medicine, there are major differences in the way antibiotics are used for companion animals (e.g., dogs, cats, pet birds, horses) versus food-producing animals. Antibiotic use in companion animals is broadly similar to humans for the treatment of infections or in select cases prophylaxis, such as post-surgery. In the case of food animals, if some animals are infected antibiotics may be administered through feed or water to the entire group for reasons of practicality or efficiency. Metaphylaxis is a term used to describe therapeutic/prophylaxis antibiotic treatment at a group level.\nThe most controversial type of group treatment in food animals is long-term, low-dose mass antibiotic treatment for purposes of growth promotion Figure 16. This practice has a high propensity to select for antimicrobial resistance and is driven by economic factors rather than treatment of clinical infection. The practice was banned by the EU in 2006 but still continues in some countries such as the United States and China.\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Pigs in cages, Quanzhou, China. As the largest consumer of veterinary antimicrobials, China is critical for combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). From Van Boekel et al. [4].\n\n\nThe reported benefits of using antibiotics for growth promotion is controversial and reports of the beneficial effects in terms of weight gains vary widely widely in the literature (1-10%). Concerns have been expressed that antimicrobial growth promoters are often used to compensate for poor hygiene/housing and healthy management [13].\nUnfortunately, use of antibiotic for growth promotion has increased dramatically with the growing demand in meat-based diets. Since 2000, meat production has plateaued in high-income countries but has grown by 68%, 64%, and 40% in Africa, Asia, and South America, respectively [4]. The transition to high-protein diets in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been facilitated by the global expansion of intensive animal production systems, in which antimicrobials are used routinely to maintain health and productivity.\nThere are 4 factors that typically determine the health of animals, (e.g., chickens):\n\nThe genetic stock of the animals\nAdequate nutrition\nHygiene of living conditions\nAdequate veterinary care\n\nWhile antibiotics may be able to improve deficiencies in 1 of the 4 areas, if multiple aspects are missing then antimicrobial resistance is unlikely to improve animal health or growth. Thus, antimicrobials are often surrogates for good hygiene on farms. Ideally, a key goal to reduce antibiotic use in animals is to further strengthen the 4 non-antibiotic aspects that are important to animal health so antibiotic use can be avoided.\nHistorically, governmental regulations have focused on toxicological dose-response data and the presence of antimicrobial residues in animal tissue, milk or other edible products (i.e. eggs) from treated animals - so called minimum residue levels (MRLs) compatible with acceptable risk in humans. While MRLs are well-understood and enforced with testing programs and penalties, these programs do not take into account selection of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.\nThe WHO has advocated for the termination of using antimicrobials for growth promotion. A recent report from the ECDC has suggested some progress in addressing this problem. Using surveillance data from 2017, the EU/EEA population mean antibiotic consumption in the 29 countries was 130 mg per kg of estimated biomass in humans and 108.3 mg per kg in food-producing animals Figure 17. This first time since the agencies began publishing the joint reports in 2011 that antibiotic use in humans has exceeded use in livestock. Consumption of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminopenicillins was considerably higher in human medicine, while consumption of macrolides was similar, and consumption of tetracyclines and polymyxins—a last-resort class of antibiotics that includes colistin—was significantly higher in food-producing animals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn 2022, new EU legislation will prohibit all forms of routine antibiotic use in farming, including preventative group treatments and medicated feeding except in extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Antibiotic use in livestock reported in 2010. Source: Our World in Data.\n\n\n\n\nThe impact of animal antibiotic use on human AMR\n\nCase study-cephalosporins\nThird generation cephalosporins (ceftotaxime, ceftriaxone) are widely used for serious infections in humans, including the treatment of urinary tract, abdominal, lung and bloodstream infections. These antibiotics are classified as “critically-important” for human health (WHO AGISAR). Ceftiofur, cefpodoxime, and cefoperazone are similar cephalosporins approved veterinary antibiotics and used predominantly for treating bacterial infections in food-producing animals including chickens and cattle Figure 18.\nResistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins is mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and AmpC enzymes. ESBL genes are highly mobile and transmitted on plasmids, transposons and other genetic elements that can spread horizontally (to surrounding bacteria and different bacterial species) and vertically (to daughter cells through replication). Consequently, resistance can spread rapidly from patient-to-patient and among different bacterial species. In recent years, growing resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins is common among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia has required greater reliance on the few remaining classes of antimicrobials such as carbapenems.\nA number of studies comparing isolates from animals, food and human infections have found a high genetic similarity or clonal isolates that carry the same ESBL genes and plasmids colonizing animals used for food production and isolates causing clinical infections in patients [14].\nCeftiofur is frequently injected in small quantities to hatching eggs or chicks as metaphylaxis for Escherichia coli infections and/or yolk sac infections [13]. This practice has been shown to select for cephalosporin resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg- an important cause of human illness in many countries that is typically associated with consumption of contaminated poultry products [15].\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Chicken farm in the United States of America.** Image source: The Guardian\n\n\nStudies conducted by the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance detected a high degree of temporal correlation in trends of resistance to ceftiofur and ceftriaxone (a drug of choice for the treatment of severe cases of salmonelloses in children and pregnant women) among Salmonella Heidelberg from clinical infections in humans, from poultry samples collected at retail stores, and in E. coli from poultry samples collected at retail stores [Figure 19][16]. Voluntary termination of ceftiofur metaphylaxis in hatcheries in the province of Quebec was followed by a precipitous drop in the prevalence of resistance to ceftiofur; subsequent reintroduction of ceftiofur in a more limited way was followed by a return to higher levels of resistance.\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Ceftiofur resistance in chicken and human Salmonella Heidelberg and chicken *E. coli\n\n\nIn Japan, voluntary withdrawal of the off-label use of ceftiofur in hatcheries in 2012 was also associated with significant decrease in broad-spectrum cephalosporin resistance in E. coli from chickens prepared for cooking. Some other countries (e.g., Denmark) have placed voluntary restrictions on its use. The label claim for day-old injection of poultry flocks was withdrawn in Europe, while some countries have banned off-label use of third-generation cephalosporins, and in other countries there is a requirement that use be restricted to situations where no other effective approved drugs are available for treatment.\nThese examples illustrate the danger of using antibiotics from the same class as critical therapies used to treat human infections for metaphylaxis or treatment in large numbers of animals. A similar pattern in poultry was also observed with mass medication of poultry flocks using fluoroquinolones antibiotics and selection of fluoroquinolone- resistant Campylobacter jejuni infections in humans [17]."

Until relatively recently, polymixins were rarely prescribed beyond topical or inhalational therapy in rare cases because of dose-limiting neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of the drugs.\nHowever, use of intravenous colistin has surged in the last decade with the increase in carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Even as human use has increased, colistin continues to be used in Brazil, Europe and China a a growth promoting and antibiotic treatment for pigs, poultry and calves.\n\nIn 2014, colistin use in EU member states in animals was higher than humans with a reported 485 tonnes- 99.7% in oral form or oral medicated feed. In China, with the world’s largest production of pigs and poultry, an estimated 12,000 tonnes of colistin was used in the food production industry[18].\nIn 2015, Lui and colleagues reported plasmid-mediated colistin-resistance gene, mcr-1, in Escherichia coli isolates obtained from animals, food and human bloodstream infections in China [18]. Alarmingly, the resistance gene has also been detected in 5% of healthy travellers from China in other parts of the world [19].\nThe mcr-1 gene has also been detected in isolates obtained from wildlife and surface water samples, demonstrating environmental contamination [20].\nAdditional plasmid-mediated colistin-resistance genes have been reported in many other bacterial species and countries, including mcr-2 from pigs in Belgium, and mcr-3,4,5 in other countries [21].\nColistin illustrates important One-Health Dimensions of AMR that differ from third generation cephalosporins. Specifically, large volumes of colistin use in animals, rather than humans, have probably have driven colistin resistance now observed in humans [22]. Using large quantities of colistin for group treatment or growth promotion in animals has probably lead to antimicrobial resistance problems in human health, even through colistin was considered in the past to be less important because other less toxic treatments were still available.\nIn 2017, China banned the use of colistin as a food additive for animals. Colistin is currently not approved as a food additive in Europe or the United States, but is still be used in LMICs as a growth promoting agent."

Such tensions are especially challenging when health care and health policy issues are involved, given how these have hitherto remained largely the responsibility of the member-states. In a pandemic, this can lead to inertia and political indecisiveness at the EU level, with member-states filling the gap with potentially contradictory or competing decisions.\nLooking ahead, it is likely that there will be several changes to the global health architecture, possibly including a new pandemic treaty and additional international collaborative mechanisms to promote preparedness and coordinate responses. In the following sections, we explore what those developments might look like in three key areas."

They reduce the incidence of both resistant and susceptible infections, thereby also decreasing antibiotic consumption.\nThe WHO has developed and Action Plan fo Leveraging the Use of Current Antibiotic to Reduce Antimicrobial Resistance [1]. However, what are the possibilities for developing new vaccines to targeted AMR in resistant gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens on the WHO priority pathogens list in Table 1?\nAs demonstrated by the recent success of the novel mRNA vaccine platform for COVID-19, developing vaccines against previously challenging targets is possible. Therefore, vaccines can play an important role in controlling AMR in the future.\nIn December 2022, The WHO recently published Bacterial Vaccines in Clinical and Preclinical Development 2021. This document examines sixty-one vaccine candidates in active clinical development and 94 candidates in confirmed active pre-clinical development were identified.\n\nThe first group (Group A) contains pathogens with vaccines already licensed. These exist against four priority pathogens for AMR: Salmonella enterica ser. Typhi, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The effectiveness of the vaccine against S. pneumoniae dramatically reduced mortality in the United States of America (USA) and Europe in comparison to other regions where the vaccine is not widely available and used.\n\nCurrent Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) do not adequately protect against TB and the development of more effective vaccines against TB should be accelerated.\n\nThe second group (Group B) includes pathogens with vaccines that are in late-stage clinical trials with high development feasibility: extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), Salmonella enterica ser. Para- typhi A, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridioides difficile.\nThe third group (Group C) contains pathogens with vaccine candidates either in early clinical trials or with moderate to high feasibility of vaccine development: enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Klebsiella pneumoniae, non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS), Campylobacter spp., and Shigella spp.\n\nVaccines against these pathogens might be available in the long term, however, short term solutions to prevent resistance should focus on other interventions to reduce AMR.\n\nThe fourth group (Group D) contains pathogens with a small number or no vaccine candidates in the pipeline and low vaccine development feasibility: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Entero- bacter spp., Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Helicobacter pylori\n\nVaccines against these pathogens are unlikely to be available in the short term, and alternative interventions to prevent AMR caused by these pathogens should be considered. It is even more worrying that the drug development pipeline for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa also is insufficient to counter this threat.\n\n\nIn this module, we will examine the potential for vaccines to reduce resistance among WHO priority pathogens Table 1. Much of this information is copied and summarized directly from the Bacterial Vaccines in Clinical and Preclinical Development 2021 Report.\n\n\n\nTable 1: WHO priority pathogens\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\nPathogens included\n\n\n\n\nCritical\nAcinetobacter baumannii (Carbapenem-resistant)\nPseudomonas aeruginosa (Carbapenem-resistant)\nEnterbacterales (3rd generation cephalosporin, carbapenem-resistant)\n\n\nHigh\nEnterococcus faecium, vancomycin-resistant\nStaphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant, vancomycin intermediate and resistant\nHelicobacter pylori, clarithromycin-resistant\nCampylobacter, fluoroquinolone-resistant\nSalmonella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae, 3rd generation cephalosporin-resistant, fluoroquinolone-resistant\n\n\nMedium\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-non-susceptible\nHaemophilus influenzae, ampicillin-resistant\nShigella spp., fluoroquinolone-resistant"

    "text": "How can vaccination reduce the spread of AMR?\n\nFirst, vaccination against a bacterial infection can reduce transmission of drug-resistant and susceptible strains directly in vaccinated populations and indirectly, in unvaccinated populations, through herd immunity Figure 1. For example, the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) in children in the USA resulted in an 84% reduction in invasive disease caused by the forms of drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae specifically targeted by the vaccine, in children under 2 years of age\n\nThe same vaccination campaign also reduced invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in over-65-year-olds by 49%, despite vaccines not being given to this group .\n\nSecond, by reducing the overall burden of infectious diseases, bacterial and viral vaccines reduce antibiotic use, a key driver of resistance\n\nRotavirus vaccination is estimated to prevent 13.6 million antibiotic prescriptions every year for children under the age of 5 in LMICs .\n\nWhile resistance has emerged to every antibiotic that has been introduced, resistance to bacterial vaccines is less an issue of concern. Consequently, vaccinations are highly attractive as tools for combating AMR.\nVaccines form part of a sustainable response to AMR, as they prevent infections without selecting for antibiotic resistance.\nVaccines can also be utilised to rapidly respond to disease outbreaks in conjunction with improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene, and appropriate use of public infection prevention measures, such as mask wearing and social distancing\nVaccines may be able to act in a way that is synergistic with antibiotics. For example, although the primary selection criteria for serotypes of S. pneumoniae included in PCV was disease burden, the majority of strains selected carried genetic elements conferring drug resistance directly reducing the burden of circulating drug-resistant strains, vaccines may make antibiotics that would otherwise have become ineffective useful again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Mechanisms of vaccine impact on AMR.

    "text": "Spotlight on specific vaccines\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)\nThree vaccines against Hib are in active preclinical development and forty-six vaccines are already licensed against Hib [2]. Indeed, vaccines against Hib have been available since the 1990s and have almost eliminated invasive Hib in children under 5 in developed countries [3]. Vaccines have been shown to reduce the prevalence of certain drug-resistant strains of Hib [4]. Although current Hib vaccines are approximately 70% effective, four vaccines are in active clinical trials, three of which were in or recently completed Phase 3 clinical trials (Table 5). For example, the paediatric hexavalent vaccine Shan 6 (NCT04429295), which was scheduled to complete its Phase 3 trial in November 2021 and has already filed an New Drug Application (NDA). In addition, LBVD, a combined DTP-HepB-IPV-Hib (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis and Hib) vaccine completed Phase 1 trials in August 2019 (NCT04429295).\nDespite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine for Hib, greater uptake and global coverage are needed to combat the increasing incidence of drug-resistant Hib [1,5].\n\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nSeventeen vaccines in preclinical development specifically target S. pneumoniae, all of which are being developed in the private sector[2]. Five of the candidates are conjugate vaccines, while other approaches include multiple antigen presenting system (MAPS), recombinant vaccine, pathogen-agnostic mechanisms, and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) . There is also work on preclinical models to demonstrate that mucosal maternal vaccination with novel pneumococcal vaccines can protect offspring from the establishment of pathogenic pneumococcal infections [6].\nCurrently, 16 vaccine candidates are in active clinical trials, including multiple pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), that follow the approach of some licensed pneumococcal vaccines, which mix purified capsular polysaccharide of pneumococcal serotypes conjugated to a carrier protein.\n\nFour vaccines are in Phase 1 clinical trials, including two 13-valent vaccines, a 15-valent euPCV vaccine, and a protein-based pneumococcal vaccine (PBPV). The last covers 70% of all pneumococcal serotypes and is scheduled for completion in April 2022 (NCT04087460).\nEight vaccines are in Phase 2 clinical trials, including multiple PCVs with valencies from 11 to 23. A pneumococcal protein vaccine (PPrV) using a recombinant protein method which proved to increase protection over current polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines is also in Phase 2 clinical trials (NCT01446926[7].\nA multiple antigen presenting MAPS vaccine,which showed proof of concept in Phase1 trials (NCT03803202), has now moved to Phase 2. Four vaccines are in Phase 3 clinical trials, all of which range from being 13- to 23-valent vaccines.\n\nThe PCV10 and PCV13 vaccines are safe, effective pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines that have been available since 2009. Another 10-valent PCV vaccine, (with overlapping serotypes with PCV10 and PCV13) was prequalified by WHO in December 2019 and a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) is licensed for use in adults.\nThese vaccines are highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and provide some protection against pneumonia. Current vaccines against S. pneumoniae have been highly effective in reducing the prevalence of drug-resistant infections Figure 5.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Impact of pneumococcal vaccination on antibiotic resistance in the United States. IPD: invasive pneumococcal disease; PCV: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.Figure is from reference [8].\n\n\n\nFive years after the first PCV was used in the USA, IPD caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains in children under age 2 decreased by 84% and penicillin-resistant IPD in adults over 65 fell by 49% [9].\nIn South Africa, the use of PCV was related to an 82% reduction in the rate of penicillin-resistant pneumococcal disease in children, and a 47% reduction in disease caused by penicillin-susceptible strains [10].\nThe high cost of vaccines against S. pneumoniae is a significant barrier to uptake and worldwide coverage is approximately 40% of the target population (1-12 months of age) . Although there are more than 100 S. pneumoniae serotypes, most strains responsible for disease are covered by currently available PCVs. Research is now aimed at reducing the cost of manufacture and increasing serotype coverage [7].\n\n\n\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n\n\n\nimage source: [11]\n\n\nThe first vaccine against M. tuberculosis, the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine, was developed 100 years ago. It is the most widely administered vaccine in the world [2].\nBCG provides moderate to good protection against severe forms of TB in infants and young children (averting thousands of paediatric deaths annually). However, the efficacy of BCG is variable in preventing adult forms of disease and wanes over time. Moreover, BCG does not reduce transmission of M. tuberculosis. Hence, the use of BCG in preventing TB in most upper-income countries is limited to at-risk populations. Safe and effective vaccines that prevent TB infection or disease across all age groups are urgently needed to achieve the goals and targets of the WHO End TB Strategy.\nDrug-resistant TB threatens TB control globally, with 500 000 out of 10 million total cases resistant to first-line treatment in 2018 alone. Second-line treatment entails high costs, longer duration, a lower success rate and is toxic. Model estimates suggest a vaccine could avert 499 000 deaths due to rifampicin-resistant TB between 2020 and 2035 [12]. There are 13 novel vaccine candidates against TB in active clinical trials; two candidates are in Phase 1, 7 are in Phase 2, and four are in Phase 3, with at least 20 in preclinical development[2].\nThe vaccines are prophylactic, therapeutic or both Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) video on developing TB vaccines\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow could vaccines alter the course of TB?\n\n\n\nOne of the multiple challenges is that the vaccine would need to be administered to adults and adolescents, who are outside the established childhood immunization schedule.\nScientific challenges include the lack of validated, predictive animal models of TB infection and disease, few biomarkers that can act as prospective signatures of the risk of developing TB or as correlates of protection, and an incomplete understanding of the nature of protective immunity to TB . From a developer perspective, vaccine R&D is an expensive process with long timelines. Industry engagement in TB vaccine development is low, owing to the lack of market incentives to invest in a disease that is concentrated in LMICs, and which disproportionately affects the poor [13]. However, a therapeutic vaccine against pulmonary TB is considered biologically feasible [14]. Research is focused on novel adjuvants to improve immunogenicity, decrease the required dose of antigen, ensure targeted delivery and optimize the interaction of the antigen with the immune system [15].\nThe fight against TB will likely require more than one type of vaccine, working in multiple ways, to prevent the establishment of an initial infection (pre-exposure) or to prevent progression to disease (post-exposure). A vaccine might also serve as an immunotherapeutic agent by shortening TB treatment or reducing the risk of recurrence after treatment completion. The current pipeline of new vaccine candidates has limited antigenic and immunological diversity to deliver on this need.\n\n\n\n\nClostridium difficile\n\n\n\nImage source: [16]\n\n\nThere are five vaccine candidates against C. difficile in preclinical trials, representing a combination of different approaches that include the MAPS platform, the exome-like bacterial vesicles and the use of Bacillus subtilis spores as a delivery agent.\nNo vaccines are currently available against C. difficile. However, two candidates are in active clinical trials, both of recombinant vaccines. The GSK2904545A recombinant protein vaccine completed phase 1 in April 2022 (NCT04026009). The PF-06425090 vaccine candidate was fast-tracked by the US FDA in 2014. However, the Phase 3 trial, which recruited 17,500 patients, failed to meet the primary endpoint of preventing C. difficile infections, though it did reduce duration and severity of disease based on secondary endpoints (NCT03090191).\nVaccines may target prevention of recurrence of C. difficile or prevention of first infection, which are very different. Current data from vaccine candidates in clinical development suggest that it may be possible to reduce symptomatic disease, but C. difficile may still persist in the host and be shed (67). An antibody to C. difficile toxin has been successfully developed, suggesting that if a vaccine could deliver local antibodies in the gut, it may be successful [2].\n\n\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nOne unlicensed vaccine candidate against K. pneumoniae is in clinical trials. Five preclinical K. pneumoniae vaccine candidates were identified using different technologies, including semi-synthetic conjugation, MAPS platform, Syntiron’s Alloy platform and the inactivated whole cells (Table 27). Phase 1/2 trials were recently initiated (NCT04959344) (Table 28) to assess the tetravalent bioconjugated vaccine candidate, KlebV4, with and without the AS03 adjuvant. Another vaccine against K. pneumoniae – MV140 (Uromune), a poorly characterized vaccine comprising heat-killed bacteria – is in late-stage clinical trials (Phase 3: NCT02543827; Phase 2: NCT04096820). Uromune was excluded from this analysis as it has been licensed in Spain since 2010. Moreover, Uromune was recommended in the 2019 European Association of Urology guidelines as immunoactive prophylaxis to reduce recurrent UTI, and retrospective studies suggest it may reduce recurrent UTI by up to 90% compared with antibiotic prophylaxis [17].\nK. pneumoniae has a high propensity to acquire resistance genes and spreads easily, in comparison with other Enterobacterales. This may be an argument for considering vaccination against certain strains. A capsular polysaccharide vaccine was developed three decades ago but failed in human trials [18]. Four of the 12 O serotypes that exist for K. pneumoniae would encompass 80% of clinical strains.\nK. pneumoniae has been associated with a high burden of neonatal sepsis in low-income countries. Clinical trials involving neonates are challenging, and commercial attractiveness is limited. In HICs, K. pneumoniae infections are most often hospital acquired. The lack of a clearly defined target population makes recruitment for clinical trials and the cost-effectiveness case for a vaccine challenging.\n\n\nAcinetobacter baumannii\n\n\n\nimage source: Wikipedia, CC BY-SA 4.0\n\n\n\nWhile no vaccines are in clinical development against A. baumannii, five vaccine candidates are in preclinical development. Of these, two are inactivated whole cell vaccine candidates, one of which additionally targets P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, and one is a conjugate vaccine which additionally targets Streptococcus agalactiae.\nMultiple candidates have been characterized in preclinical studies based on recombinant proteins, inactivated/attenuated whole cells and surface polysaccharides that have not made it to the clinical stage. The lack of vaccines against A. baumannii in clinical development might be explained by the biological complexities, which makes it scientifically challenging to arrive at a sound concept for an A. baumannii vaccine. In addition, there are number of challenges along the pathway to clinical development. Even if one of the candidates in preclinical development made it to the clinical stages of development, large efficacy trials would be required due to low disease prevalence in vulnerable populations.\nThe target population includes critically ill patients with multiple comorbidities and/or a compromised immune response, and who are often in intensive care. All of this makes it hard to recruit subjects for such trials and complicates the establishment of appropriate efficacy end points [19]. In addition, there is currently no precedent for the routine use of vaccines to prevent hospital-acquired infections in high-risk populations. It is unclear when such a vaccine would need to be administered to be effective if a patient were hospitalized.\n\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nNo active candidates are in clinical development against P. aeruginosa.\nFour active P. aeruginosa vaccine candidates in the later stages of preclinical development. These use a range of technologies, including the MAPS platform (102), phage-based vaccine, a live attenuated Salmonella strain and inactivated whole cell vaccine. In addition, multiple promising vaccine candidates were identified in earlier stages of preclinical development. Several vaccines have advanced to clinical trials and failed over the past 3 decades (79, 103–105).\nIn the last ten years, VLA43 (IC43) completed a Phase 2/3 clinical trial (NCT01563263) and was discontinued as it failed to reduce all-cause mortality [20]. A P. aeruginosa vaccine that incorporates 8 of the 16–20 different P. aeruginosa International Antigenic Typing Schema (IATS) subtypes could provide approximately 80% coverage of clinical strains. However, similarly to Acinetobacter infections, the incidence of P. aeruginosa infections in hospitals, and the risk factors and co-morbidities associated with these infections make it hard to conduct a clinical trial without specifically targeting high-risk populations. These high-risk populations include those in intensive care units (ICUs), nursing homes or long-term acute care facilities, or patients who are immunosuppressed due to surgery or immunotherapy. This makes clinical development very challenging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe challenge of designing clinical trials for vaccines that target MDR and XDR gram-negative pathogens\n\n\n\nOne of the main difficulties facing the VLA43 trial was defining end points [20]. Impact on mortality was hard to demonstrate in critically ill patients, many of whom were receiving antibiotics, particularly without selecting a group of patients at high risk of P. aeruginosa infection. The administration of a vaccine at ICU admission left limited time for a protective immunological response. A vaccine-based approach to P. aeruginosa prevention may be more effective if at-risk target populations can be identified prior to ICU admission (e.g., patients with cystic fibrosis are at risk of P. aeruginosa infection and may be a good target group).\n\n\n\n\nEnterococcus faecium\nNo vaccine candidates against E. faecium are currently in preclinical or clinical trials. Several capsular polysaccharides and surface-associated proteins have been described as potential antigens ; however, these have not yet arrived at late stages of preclinical research.\nE. faecium was also identified by the Wellcome Trust as not well suited for vaccine development due to comparatively low incidence, morbidity and mortality. In addition, there are multiple factors that make vaccine development against E. faecium challenging. Natural immunity response to the switch from commensal to pathogen is not well understood, correlates of protection are lacking, and the target population for a vaccine is not clearly defined\nE. faecium infections have relatively low incidence and tend to affect highly immunocompromised patients with a range of co-morbidities, which would be challenging to target for vaccination. Recent estimates the burden of E. faecium deaths associated with AMR at 100 000-250 000 globally in 2019.\n\n\nStaphylococcus aureus (including MRSA)\nThere are currently 12 active preclinical vaccine candidates against S. aureus.\nThere are 4 major challenges with developing a S. aureus vaccine.\n\nS. aureus is part of the normal human flora (different than S. pneumoniae)\nS. aureus produces multiple diseases- which disease should be targeted\nS. aureus has multiple virulence factors- Which antigens should be targeted?\nLack of immune correlates-biomarks for predicting diseases (i.e. antibody levels)\n\nDespite relatively high industry investment, many vaccine candidates against S. aureus have been developed and failed [21]. Over the last 10 years, nine vaccine candidates in clinical development have been discontinued or research has become inactive, mostly in Phase 1 clinical trials. For example, the recombinant toxin vaccine STEBVax (IBT-V01) (NCT00974935) was discontinued in order to work towards the IBT-V02 pentavalent toxoid vaccine, currently in preclinical stages. Also, AVO0328, a partially de-N-acetylated poly-N-acetyl glucosamine polymer that targeted a variety of bacterial species, including S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, shows no recent activity (NCT02853617). NDV-3A recombinant vaccine failed to prevent nasal acquisition of S. aureus in military recruits during Phase 2a trials (NCT03455309) (108). The four-antigen candidate SA4Ag was terminated during Phase 2b (NCT02388165) in 2019 due to futility. Phase 3 failure also occurred in the V710 IsdB vaccine, as trials were terminated when interim analysis reported increased mortality and adverse side effects in vaccine recipients who developed an S. aureus infection-possibly due to a hyperimmune response.\nAt present, it is unclear what antigen targets would allow a vaccine to provide protection against S. aureus infection (13) In addition, correlates of protection are lacking, and vaccines that have shown protection in animal models have failed in clinical trials . Multiple candidate monoclonal antibodies against S. aureus have failed in clinical trials (112). Finally, S. aureus causes a diverse range clinical syndromes, including bacteraemia, skin infections, pneumonia and others, and it is not clear whether a vaccine against one would protect against others\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPfizer Press Release December, 2018\n\n\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the Phase 2b trial STRIVE (STaphylococcus aureus SuRgical Inpatient Vaccine Efficacy) evaluating the company’s investigational Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) multi-antigen vaccine (PF-06290510) is being discontinued due to futility. This decision is based on a recommendation from an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), composed of external experts, after conducting a pre-planned interim analysis. The DMC concluded from these data that the study reached futility, meaning that there is low statistical probability for the study to meet the pre-defined primary efficacy objective in adults undergoing elective spinal fusion surgery after completing a planned Phase 3 expansion of the study. A safety review by the DMC indicated that the investigational vaccine has been safe and well tolerated. STRIVE trial participants who are enrolled in the study will complete the study’s follow-up evaluations. Pfizer is evaluating next steps for the potential development of a S. aureus vaccine"
